## Critical Gaps

- [x] **Field equation for coupling parameter alpha**
  - ~~No governing equation exists for alpha(x,t)~~
  - Alpha is now derived from the Lagrangian: α = cos(ψ − φ)
  - Field equations derived via Euler-Lagrange in
    [mathematical_formalization.md](docs/research/mathematical_formalization.md) Section 3
  - **Sign error corrected:** coupling must be +cos for stability (Section 2.3)

- [x] **Energy cost of phase control**
  - Derived from Hamiltonian in Section 8
  - Decoupling energy per mode: ΔE = gᵢ (coupling constant)
  - Order of magnitude: ~10⁻⁹ J per kg (gravitational self-energy scale)
  - Gradient energy cost: E_grad = ∫ ½(∇(ψ−φ))² d³x

- [x] **Stability analysis**
  - Linearized perturbations satisfy Klein-Gordon equation (Section 6.2)
  - Dispersion relation: ω² = k² + 2g > 0 — all modes stable (Section 6.3)
  - Lyapunov stability proved via bounded Hamiltonian (Section 6.5)
  - Asymptotic stability holds in overdamped (Kuramoto) limit

- [x] **Conservation law compliance**
  - Energy conservation: proved via Noether's theorem + direct verification
    (Section 5.1, 5.4)
  - Momentum conservation: proved via Noether's theorem (Section 5.2)
  - Phase charge conservation: proved via global phase symmetry (Section 5.3)
  - Causality: preserved by Lorentz-invariant Lagrangian construction

- [x] **Quantum description of spacetime phase field (phi)**
  - ~~phi is currently undefined in standard physics~~
  - φ identified as the phase of a vacuum superfluid condensate (SVT)
  - Connected to established research: Volovik (2003), Barceló-Liberati-Visser (2005)
  - Lorentz invariance emerges at low energies (Volovik mechanism)
  - See [advanced_formalization.md](docs/research/advanced_formalization.md) §1
  - **Remaining:** microscopic structure of the condensate is unknown

- [x] **Quantitative GR recovery (Newtonian limit)**
  - Newtonian 1/r potential recovered in weak-field static limit (Section 7)
  - Poisson equation ∇²φ = −ρ_phase recovered (Section 7.5)
  - Newton's constant G identified via coupling-to-mass mapping (Section 7.5)
  - **Remaining:** Post-Newtonian corrections (perihelion, lensing, waves)

- [x] **Numerical experimental predictions**
  - δα at Earth surface: ~10⁻¹⁹ (Section 9.1)
  - BEC coherence amplification factor: √N (Section 9.2)
  - BEC prediction (N=10⁶): δα ~ 10⁻⁷ (approaching testability)
  - Falsifiable: coherent vs incoherent matter should show different free-fall

- [x] **Connect to Kuramoto model formally**
  - Overdamped limit of PDTP = standard Kuramoto model (Section 4.1)
  - PDTP is a relativistic, spatially-extended, second-order Kuramoto (Section 4.3)
  - Known Kuramoto results imported: critical coupling, phase transition,
    spontaneous synchronization (Section 4.2)

## Structural Requirements

- [x] Preserve Lorentz invariance — Lagrangian is Lorentz scalar by construction
- [x] Preserve energy-momentum conservation — proved via Noether (Section 5)
- [x] Be derivable from a consistent Lagrangian — Sections 2–3
- [x] Be experimentally testable — predictions in Section 9
- [x] Be distinguishable from existing GR/QFT predictions — coherence-dependent
  gravity is unique to PDTP (advanced_formalization.md §4.1)

---

## Completed (Advanced Topics — Part 2)

- [x] **Post-Newtonian corrections** ([advanced_formalization.md](docs/research/advanced_formalization.md) §2)
  - Cosine nonlinearity gives 1/r² correction to potential → perihelion precession ✓
  - Correct functional form (1/r³ force); magnitude depends on parameter fit
  - Gravitational waves propagate at c ✓ (Lorentz invariant by construction)
  - **Unresolved:** GW polarization (PDTP: scalar; GR: tensor); PPN parameter γ exact value
  - **Unresolved:** Shapiro delay, frame-dragging require full PPN calculation

- [x] **Quantum description of spacetime phase field** ([advanced_formalization.md](docs/research/advanced_formalization.md) §1)
  - φ = phase of vacuum superfluid condensate (SVT identification)
  - Connected to Volovik (2003), Barceló-Liberati-Visser (2005), Unruh (1981)
  - **Remaining:** microscopic condensate structure

- [x] **EM and nuclear force integration** ([advanced_formalization.md](docs/research/advanced_formalization.md) §3)
  - PDTP adds gravitational coupling to Standard Model (doesn't replace it)
  - Full combined Lagrangian written (L_PDTP + L_SM)
  - Gauge invariance resolved: gravity couples to de Broglie phase (gauge-invariant)
  - **Remaining:** photon coupling to φ (needs tensor extension)

- [x] **Experimental test design** ([advanced_formalization.md](docs/research/advanced_formalization.md) §4)
  - Dual-state BEC atom interferometry protocol designed
  - Three-phase experiment: baseline → increased coherence → phase modulation
  - Signal estimates: conservative ~10⁻¹⁶, optimistic ~10⁻¹³ (Δg/g)
  - Current precision ~10⁻¹² — approaching testability

## Remaining Work (Hard Open Problems)

- [x] **Gravitational wave polarization mismatch**
  - ~~PDTP gives 1 scalar mode; GR gives 2 tensor modes (LIGO-confirmed)~~
  - Resolved: tensor modes emerge from condensate tetrad structure (Volovik mechanism)
  - PDTP predicts E(2) class N₃: 2 tensor + 1 breathing mode
  - Breathing mode is a new testable prediction (multi-detector GW polarimetry)
  - See [hard_problems.md](docs/research/hard_problems.md) §1

- [x] **Full PPN parameter calculation**
  - γ = 1 from acoustic metric density perturbation (equal g₀₀ and gᵢⱼ)
  - β = 1 from Lorentz invariance and linear weak-field superposition
  - Independently: massive scalar Yukawa suppression → γ ≈ 1 at solar system scales
  - Nordtvedt parameter η_N = 0 (consistent with LLR)
  - **Caveat:** γ = 1 depends on condensate equation of state parameter κ = −2
  - See [hard_problems.md](docs/research/hard_problems.md) §2

- [x] **Vacuum condensate microscopic structure**
  - Constraints from PDTP Lagrangian: U(1) symmetry, Lorentz-invariant ground state,
    correct dispersion relation, cosine coupling emergence
  - Connected to Group Field Theory (Oriti 2014, Gielen & Sindoni 2016): spacetime
    as condensate of quantum tetrahedra
  - **Remains genuinely open:** microscopic constituents unknown (open in SVT itself)
  - See [hard_problems.md](docs/research/hard_problems.md) §3

- [x] **Photon coupling to φ**
  - Resolved: photons couple INDIRECTLY via acoustic metric (not via cos coupling)
  - Photons follow null geodesics of the acoustic metric
  - Light bending: θ = 4GM/(bc²) — matches GR (factor of 2 from γ = 1)
  - Gravitational redshift: Δν/ν = ΔU/c² — matches GR
  - No tensor extension of fundamental Lagrangian needed; tensor structure is emergent
  - See [hard_problems.md](docs/research/hard_problems.md) §4

## Remaining Questions (Identified During Part 3 Work)

- [x] **Derive κ = −2 from first principles**
  - ~~Currently assumed; should be derived from the condensate dynamics~~
  - Derived via Painlevé-Gullstrand representation: acoustic metric with constant
    density + free-fall velocity = Schwarzschild metric, which has γ = 1
  - κ is coordinate-dependent (0 in PG, −2 in isotropic); γ = 1 is physical
  - Independently confirmed: relativistic Euler equation with c_s = c gives δρ/ρ₀ = 2U
  - See [hard_problems.md](docs/research/hard_problems.md) §2.11

- [x] **Condensate tetrad structure**
  - Analyzed: He-3A order parameter (Volovik) provides the physical precedent
  - PDTP scalar Lagrangian does NOT produce tetrads — explicit extension needed
  - Minimal extension: Φ_vacuum = √ρ₀ e^{iφ} e^a_μ (tetrad + phase)
  - **Remains the most important structural gap in PDTP**
  - See [hard_problems.md](docs/research/hard_problems.md) §1.10

- [x] **Breathing mode amplitude relative to tensor**
  - Mapped to Brans-Dicke: h_breathing/h_tensor < 1/(2ω+3) < 1.25 × 10⁻⁵ (Cassini)
  - Massive scalar adds Yukawa suppression above threshold frequency
  - Below current LIGO detection threshold; may be accessible with 5+ detectors in 2030s
  - See [hard_problems.md](docs/research/hard_problems.md) §1.9

- [x] **EM coupling constant G_EM in equation (4.3)**
  - ~~Should be fixed by requiring equivalence principle (E = mc²)~~
  - **Resolved: the G_EM term must be REMOVED.** EM stress-energy tensor is traceless
    (T^μ_μ = 0), so photons cannot source a scalar field at classical level. This is
    Nordström's problem. Equation (4.3) replaced by equation (4.7) with only matter sources.
  - Photons still gravitate via acoustic metric geodesics (test particles) and through
    bound EM energy in composite matter (gravitational sources)
  - See [hard_problems.md](docs/research/hard_problems.md) §4.8

## New Questions (Identified During Part 3b Work)

- [x] **Free photon radiation as gravitational source**
  - Free photons don't source □φ (EM trace = 0) — established physics
  - Energy bookkeeping: emitter loses mass E/c², absorber gains it back
  - Thermal equilibrium suppression: t_interaction/t_grav ~ 10⁻¹⁴ in stellar interiors
  - Solar system deficit: ΔM/M☉ ~ 2 × 10⁻²¹ per second — undetectable
  - Self-limiting argument: radiation dominates only when tightly coupled
  - **Conclusion:** cosmological problem, not astrophysical; negligible for all
    post-equality physics. Radiation-era implications addressed separately.
  - See [photon_gravity_analysis.md](docs/research/photon_gravity_analysis.md)

- [x] **Radiation-dominated era cosmology**
  - Matter-era Friedmann equation derived from condensate Euler + continuity
  - Cosmic expansion = condensate Hubble flow v_i = H(t) x_i
  - Tight-coupling resolves photon contribution: effective mass m_eff = m_b + ρ_γ/(n_b c²)
  - Self-limiting: radiation dominates only when tightly coupled to baryons
  - **Genuine gap:** decoupled neutrinos at BBN (41% of ρ_total missing, ~23% error in H)
  - Resolution requires acoustic metric tensor channel or condensate extension
  - See [radiation_era_cosmology.md](docs/research/radiation_era_cosmology.md)

- [x] **Derive Newton's constant G from coupling constants gᵢ independently**
  - Dimensional analysis: G = 𝒞 c^(5/2)/√(ℏρ₀), exact for ρ₀ = ρ_Planck (§2)
  - Coupling gᵢ shown to be geometric (~4πRᵢ), not independent parameters (§3)
  - Reduces N+2 apparent free parameters to 1 effective unknown (𝒞 or ρ₀)
  - Energy-cost circularity resolved: decoupling energy from gᵢ, not Gm²/R (§7)
  - **Remaining gap:** dimensionless prefactor 𝒞 requires condensate microphysics
  - Full derivation needs: what condenses, why, and the ground-state density
  - See [G_derivation.md](docs/research/G_derivation.md)

- [x] **Strong-field equivalence principle**
  - Phase difference δψ = compactness Ξ = GM/(Rc²): 0.21 for NS, 0.50 at BH horizon
  - Nonlinearity sin(δψ)/δψ: 0.7% for NS, 4.1% at horizon — mild throughout
  - Strong-field Nordtvedt parameter: η ~ Ξ²/6 ≈ 7×10⁻³ for NS
  - Gravitational binding energy gravitates correctly to leading order: M_eff = M(1−Ξ/2)
  - Cosine saturation unobservable: δψ < 0.5 for all objects outside their horizons
  - Acoustic horizon at r = 2GM/c² (exact Schwarzschild radius)
  - **Tension:** Double pulsar Ṗ_b (0.013% precision) vs ~1% PDTP GW emission deficit
  - Resolution requires numerical NS interior solution or self-consistent metric proof
  - See [strong_field_ep.md](docs/research/strong_field_ep.md)

- [x] **Explicit momentum balance for phase-gradient motion**
  - Derived local momentum transfer force density: F^k_j = −gⱼ sin(ψⱼ−φ) ∂^k ψⱼ
  - Worked Example 1: Test particle in static phase gradient — field absorbs equal/opposite momentum
  - Worked Example 2: Two-body exchange — spacetime field acts as transparent intermediary
  - Newton's second law (F = mg) recovered from momentum transfer rate
  - "Reactionless drive" objection fully resolved: propellant-free ≠ momentum-violating
  - EM analogy: Poynting vector ↔ (∂₀φ)(∇φ) structural correspondence
  - Earth–Sun quantitative budget: field momentum ~10⁻⁸ of matter momenta (post-Newtonian hierarchy)
  - Key result: dP^k_ψ/dt = −dP^k_φ/dt (Newton's third law for phase-gradient motion)
  - See [momentum_balance.md](docs/research/momentum_balance.md)

## Stretch Goals (Would Strengthen the Framework)

- [x] **Derive the Koide formula** from phase harmonic geometry
  - Proved: Z₃ phase parametrization √mᵢ = μ(1 + δ cos(θ₀ + 2πi/3)) gives Q = (1+δ²/2)/3
  - Q = 2/3 ⟺ δ = √2 (exact mathematical result)
  - Geometric interpretation: √m vector at 45° to democratic direction (1,1,1)
  - Lepton fit: μ = 17.72 MeV^{1/2}, θ₀ ≈ 2/9 (Brannen)
  - Quark extension: (c,b,t) near-Koide Q = 0.669, signed (s,c,b) ≈ 0.675
  - Physical argument: δ = √2 from equal partition of symmetric/breaking energy
  - See [koide_derivation.md](docs/research/koide_derivation.md)

- [x] **Derive the fine-structure constant** from phase impedance matching
  - Exact identity: α = Z₀/(2R_K) = (EM impedance)/(2 × quantum impedance) = 1/137.036
  - PDTP interpretation: coupling efficiency between EM and matter-wave phase media
  - Impedance mismatch explains why α is small: R_K/Z₀ ≈ 69 (media stiffness ratio)
  - Length scale cascade: r_e = αλ̄_C = α²a₀ as standing-wave harmonics
  - Running of α: energy-dependent quantum impedance from vacuum polarization
  - Wyler's formula discussed (α_W⁻¹ = 137.036..., 0.6 ppm, but no solid derivation)
  - **Honest status:** structural interpretation achieved; numerical derivation remains open
  - See [fine_structure_derivation.md](docs/research/fine_structure_derivation.md)

- [x] **Simulation of emergent GR**
  - N-body simulation of phase-coupled oscillators → 5 independent tests
  - Smooth curvature from N=10 to N=1000 discrete oscillators (< 0.5% error)
  - Quantitative match to Newtonian predictions: 1/r potential (1.35% error),
    1/d force law (exponent −0.984), Kuramoto synchronization (R = 1.0000),
    weak-field linearization (machine-precision match)
  - See [emergent_gr_results.md](docs/research/emergent_gr_results.md)
  - Simulation: [emergent_gr_simulation.py](simulations/emergent_gr_simulation.py)

- [x] **Derive Hawking temperature from acoustic horizon** *(Part 24 — 2026-02-25)*
  - PDTP condensate flow v = −√(2GM/r); acoustic horizon at r_H = 2GM/c² (Schwarzschild)
  - Surface gravity: κ_s = (1/2)|d(c²−v²)/dr|_{r_H} = c⁴/(4GM) — exact match to GR
  - Hawking temperature: T_H = ℏκ_s/(2πk_Bc) = ℏc³/(8πGMk_B) ✓ (Unruh formula applied)
  - Trans-Planckian resolved: lattice cutoff at ω_Planck; spectrum preserved by Unruh & Schützhold (2003)
  - Robustness check: ω_Planck/(κ_s/c) ~ 10¹¹ for stellar BHs — condition well satisfied
  - Physical mechanism: phonon pair separation at sonic horizon (cf. Steinhauer 2016 BEC experiment)
  - Key references: Unruh (1981) PRL 46 1351; Visser (1998) CQG 15 1767; Unruh & Schützhold (2003) PRD 71 024028

## Open Problems (Future Work)

### Structural Gaps

- [x] **Condensate tetrad extension**
  - Extended order parameter: Φ = √ρ₀ e^{iφ} e^a_μ (phase + tetrad)
  - Extended Lagrangian: Palatini action + covariantized phase coupling (eq. 4.8)
  - Field equations derived: torsion (vanishes), Einstein, covariant □_g φ, covariant □_g ψ
  - DOF counting: 16 − 6 (Lorentz) − 4 (diffeo) = 6 off-shell → 2 tensor + 1 breathing
  - Linearized analysis: □h^{TT}_{ij} = 0 (tensor at c) + □θ + 2gθ = 0 (massive breathing)
  - E(2) class N₃: matches LIGO observations (2 tensor) + suppressed breathing
  - All Parts 1–11 results preserved in weak-field limit
  - Symmetry breaking: GL(4,ℝ) × U(1) → SO(3,1), Goldstone interpretation
  - New predictions unlocked: frame-dragging, Kerr metric, torsion at extreme densities
  - GFT condensate identified as candidate microscopic origin
  - **Remaining:** microscopic origin of tetrad structure, symmetry breaking potential
  - See [tetrad_extension.md](docs/research/tetrad_extension.md)

- [x] **Double pulsar tension resolution**
  - Original tension: scalar-only PDTP predicts ~1.5% GW emission deficit (sin(Ξ)/Ξ)²
  - Double pulsar Ṗ_b measured to 0.013% precision — was 100× tension
  - **Resolution via two arguments:**
    1. Tetrad extension (Part 12): dominant GW channel = tensor modes → Einstein equation → quadrupole formula = GR
    2. U(1) symmetry: φ → φ+c, ψ → ψ+c leaves Lagrangian invariant → scalar charge α_A = 0 for all bodies → zero scalar radiation
  - Ṗ_b^PDTP = Ṗ_b^GR exactly (tensor emission = GR, scalar emission = 0)
  - Spontaneous scalarization ruled out (β_A = 0 identically, unlike DEF theory)
  - Consistent with double pulsar (0.013%), Hulse-Taylor (0.3%), and all future binary pulsar tests
  - **Remaining:** numerical NS interior solution desirable (not required) for independent confirmation
  - See [double_pulsar_resolution.md](docs/research/double_pulsar_resolution.md)

### Genuinely Open Problems

- [x] **Condensate microphysics (microscopy)**
  - What are the microscopic constituents of the vacuum condensate?
  - **Status:** Genuinely open — thorough analysis completed (Part 14)
  - 10 constraints on the condensate compiled from Parts 1–13
  - 5 candidate theories analyzed: Volovik (trans-Planckian), GFT, LQG, causal sets, string theory
  - **GFT identified as best candidate** (7/10 constraints satisfied)
    - Natural tetrad structure from quantum tetrahedra
    - Condensate phase = PDTP phase φ
    - Already derives Friedmann equation (Gielen, Oriti, Sindoni 2013)
    - Critical gap: cos(ψ−φ) coupling not yet derived from GFT
  - Downstream blockage analysis: phenomenological predictions (PPN, GW, binary pulsars) UNAFFECTED by universality; only "deep" quantities (G prefactor, Λ, α_EM) blocked
  - Universality argument: PDTP works as effective theory regardless of microphysics (Volovik)
  - GFT-PDTP dictionary constructed with 3 missing links identified
  - Research roadmap: near-term (equation correspondence), medium-term (matter coupling), long-term (coupling constants)
  - **Remaining:** This is the deepest open problem — genuinely unsolved across all QG programs
  - See [condensate_microphysics.md](docs/research/condensate_microphysics.md)

- [x] **Decoupled neutrino energy at BBN**
  - At Big Bang nucleosynthesis (z ~ 10⁹), neutrinos carry 41% of ρ_total
  - In scalar-only PDTP: neutrinos don't source □φ (trace = 0) → 23% error in H at BBN
  - **Resolution via tetrad extension (Part 15):**
    1. Extended PDTP (Part 12) derives Einstein equation G_μν = 8πG T_μν
    2. The (0,0) component gives Friedmann equation with FULL ρ_total including ρ_ν
    3. The tensor sector uses T_00 = ρ_ν directly — the trace T = 0 is irrelevant
    4. Same pattern as double pulsar resolution (Part 13): scalar-only artifact resolved by tensor sector
  - Result: H²_PDTP = H²_GR at ALL epochs (BBN, equality, recombination, present)
  - Two-sector structure: tensor (all energy) + scalar (phase-locking mechanism)
  - See [radiation_era_cosmology.md](docs/research/radiation_era_cosmology.md) §8

### Cosmological Open Problems

- [x] **Hubble tension from phase drift**
  - Standard physics: H₀ = 73.0 ± 1.0 km/s/Mpc (local, SH0ES) vs
    H₀ = 67.4 ± 0.5 km/s/Mpc (CMB + ΛCDM, Planck) — ~5σ tension
  - **Quantitative analysis completed (Part 16):**
    1. Phase drift rate ∝ 1/ρ_local (nonlinear enhancement from cosine coupling)
    2. Direct scalar drift mechanism: Cassini bound ε_s < 10⁻⁵ → quantitatively insufficient
    3. Backreaction from phase inhomogeneity: σ²_δψ ~ 10⁻¹⁰ → also insufficient (~9 orders of magnitude)
    4. Both mechanisms fail because phase mismatches Φ/c² ~ 10⁻⁵ are too small
  - **Honest conclusion:** PDTP cannot currently explain the 8% Hubble tension
  - Deep connection identified: Hubble tension ↔ dark energy ↔ phase drift (common root)
  - Conditional predictions: if scalar sector relevant, H₀ should correlate with environment density
  - See [hubble_tension_analysis.md](docs/research/hubble_tension_analysis.md)

- [x] **Cosmological constant / dark energy from phase drift**
  - Standard physics: ρ_Λ ≈ 6 × 10⁻²⁷ kg/m³ (68% of universe), origin unknown
  - Cosmological constant problem: QFT predicts ρ_vacuum ~ ρ_Planck, observed
    value is 10¹²² times smaller — worst prediction in physics
  - **Quantitative analysis completed (Part 17):**
    1. Scalar sector phase-filters vacuum fluctuations (⟨sin(ψ_vac − φ)⟩ = 0)
    2. ρ₀ vs ρ_Λ reframing: dark energy = condensate perturbation δρ₀/ρ₀ ~ 10⁻¹²³
    3. Phase drift → dynamical dark energy with w ≠ −1 (consistent with DESI 4.2σ evidence)
    4. BUT: tensor sector has G_μν = 8πG T_μν → inherits GR's full Λ problem
  - **Honest conclusion:** PDTP provides partial reframing (scalar sector novel mechanism)
    but cannot solve the cosmological constant problem (tensor sector unsolved)
  - Cannot derive ρ_Λ from first principles; drift rate requires microphysics
  - Common root with Hubble tension and phase drift mechanism (Part 16)
  - See [cosmological_constant_analysis.md](docs/research/cosmological_constant_analysis.md)

- [x] **Aharonov-Bohm effect and PDTP phase structure**
  - The AB effect (Tonomura 1986) proves phase is physically real and can
    alter physics without any local force — the same paradigm PDTP uses
  - **Deep analysis completed (Part 18):**
    1. COW experiment: PDTP reproduces gravitational phase shift exactly
       (Δφ = (m/ℏ)∫Φdt) — consistency check via weak-field limit
    2. Fiber bundle classification: PDTP = U(1)_global × SO(3,1) product
       bundle (trivial scalar bundle + GR frame bundle)
    3. Topological defects: cosmic strings interpreted as quantized vortex
       lines in the condensate phase field (∮∇φ·dl = 2πn)
    4. EM–gravity: genuine structural parallel (both phase coupling), but
       gauging PDTP's U(1) does NOT naturally produce electromagnetism
    5. Impact assessment: no modifications to existing results needed —
       geometric consistency confirmed across all previous Parts
  - 2022 Overstreet et al. (Science) observed gravitational AB phase shift
    with atom interferometry — strongest experimental support for phase paradigm
  - **Honest conclusion:** PDTP is geometrically consistent; topological
    aspects (cosmic strings as vortices) are suggestive but speculative;
    EM–gravity parallel is real but not unification
  - See [aharonov_bohm_pdtp.md](docs/research/aharonov_bohm_pdtp.md)

- [x] **Phase drift mechanism** *(Part 19 — 2026-02-22)*
  - Analyzed four candidate mechanisms for cosmic-scale phase de-synchronization:
    1. Finite coherence length ξ = c/√(2g) (★★★★ — primary mechanism, explains
       scale transition directly via exponential decay of phase correlations)
    2. Cosmological expansion (★★★ — provides time evolution through a(t),
       self-consistent but circular)
    3. Thermal fluctuations / two-fluid model (★★★ — maps dark energy to
       condensate normal fraction; universe is deep in superfluid phase, T ≪ T_c)
    4. Topological defects / phase vortices (★★☆ — Kibble-Zurek formation
       mechanism, inter-vortex spacing sets effective ξ, most speculative)
  - Developed effective Langevin equation: δφ̈ + 3H(t)δφ̇ + g_eff(t)δφ = η(t)
  - Qualitative w(z) matches DESI DR2: w₀ > −1, w_a < 0 emerge naturally from
    overdamped → resonant → relaxation dynamics without fine-tuning
  - Honest conclusion: framework, not solution — quantitative predictions require
    condensate microphysics (g, T_cond, n_vortex, γ_micro all unknown)
  - See [phase_drift_mechanism.md](docs/research/phase_drift_mechanism.md)

### Structural Directions (from external review, Part 17)

These items were identified through independent external review of the
cosmological constant analysis. Both reviews converged on the same
structural diagnosis and recommended directions.

- [x] **Vacuum energy and the tensor sector: background subtraction mechanism** *(2026-02-24)*
  - The "PDTP trilemma": cannot simultaneously have (a) exact GR recovery,
    (b) scalar vacuum filtering, and (c) cosmological constant solution
  - Both external reviews recommend Option 3: condensate background subtraction
  - Key idea: if the condensate ground state defines the metric background,
    then ρ₀ is "already included" in the geometry — only deviations δρ gravitate
  - Possible implementation: T_μν^phys = T_μν − ⟨T_μν⟩_condensate
  - This modifies what emerges from the Palatini variation in Part 12
  - Related approaches: unimodular gravity, vacuum energy sequestering,
    emergent gravity models, analogue gravity (acoustic metric doesn't feel
    total fluid mass — only perturbations)
  - **Answered:** Palatini variation does NOT naturally produce background
    subtraction — explicit action modification required (Option B: perturbative
    expansion around ground state is the most natural implementation)
  - **Risk assessed:** Uniform subtraction does not modify local gravitational
    dynamics — solar system tests are passed; time-varying subtraction is
    bounded by Brans-Dicke constraints
  - See [vacuum_background_subtraction.md](docs/research/vacuum_background_subtraction.md)
  - Status: completed 2026-02-24

- [x] **Dark energy as condensate normal fraction (temperature model)** *(2026-02-24)*
  - Map dark energy to condensate thermodynamics near critical temperature T_c
  - Superfluid analogy: below T_c → full coherence; near T_c → normal fraction grows
  - Dark energy density ∝ normal fraction of condensate = (T/T_c)^β or similar
  - This would naturally produce: time evolution of w, w₀ > −1, w_a < 0
  - Must model: order parameter evolution, condensate fraction f(t), effective
    equation of state from φ dynamics
  - **Key question:** Is the universe sitting near criticality? Is this stable
    or accidental? If criticality is an attractor state, this becomes powerful
  - Connects to: DESI DR2 results (energy density peaked at z ≈ 0.45),
    condensate microphysics (Part 14), phase drift mechanism
  - **Answered:**
    - ρ_DE = f_n × ρ₀ (normal fraction of Planck-density condensate)
    - Equation of state: w_drift = (K−V)/(K+V) naturally gives w₀ > −1, w_a < 0
    - Universe is NOT near criticality: T_cond/T_c ~ 10⁻³¹ (f_n ~ 10⁻¹²³)
    - No attractor mechanism known — coincidence problem persists
    - Qualitative DESI DR2 match (peaked density at z ~ 0.45) from Langevin dynamics
    - Canonical scalar cannot produce phantom w < −1 (DESI tension noted)
  - See [dark_energy_normal_fraction.md](docs/research/dark_energy_normal_fraction.md)
  - Status: completed 2026-02-24

- [x] **Derive explicit w(z) from phase drift dynamics** *(Part 25 — 2026-02-25)*
  - Slow-roll approximation: ε = g_eff/(9H²) (phase-locking coupling / Hubble friction)
  - Equation of state: w(z) = [ε(z) − 1] / [ε(z) + 1]
  - CPL prediction: w_a = −(1 − w₀²)/2 × (m + 3Ω_m)  for g_eff ∝ a^m
  - Constant coupling (m=0): w_a ≈ −0.15  (2.1σ below DESI central value)
  - DE-tracking coupling (m=3): w_a ≈ −0.62  (consistent with DESI, 0.4σ)
  - Best-fit m ≈ 3.8 matches DESI's w_a = −0.75 exactly
  - Consistency line in (w₀, w_a) plane: falsifiable by future surveys (Euclid, DESI Y5)
  - R ≡ −w_a/[(1−w₀²)/2] = m + 3Ω_m directly measures condensate coupling evolution
  - Phantom tension: PDTP canonical scalar cannot produce w < −1 (honest assessment)
  - See [wz_dark_energy_pdtp.md](docs/research/wz_dark_energy_pdtp.md)

- [x] **Free parameter m analysis** *(Part 26 — 2026-02-26)*
  - The coupling evolution exponent m in g_eff(a) = g₀ a^m was a free parameter
  - Self-consistency condition derived: m = 6ε (ε = slow-roll parameter)
  - With DESI ε₀ = 0.095 → m = 0.57, giving w_a ≈ −0.24 (1.8σ from DESI)
  - Dynamical scaling argument: m = 2 − η ≈ 2.0 (XY universality class)
  - Thermal activation (speculative): m = 3 (2D) or m = 4.5 (3D)
  - **Honest finding:** m = 3 (from Part 25) was curve-fitting, not a derivation
  - Best internal prediction: m ≈ 0.57 (self-consistency) or m ≈ 2 (scaling)
  - Escape hatch: non-constant ε(a) could boost effective m (calculable)
  - Falsifiable predictions robust regardless of m: consistency line R = m + 3Ω_m,
    phantom bound w ≥ −1

- [x] **Scalar vs tensor gravity analysis** *(Part 27 — 2026-02-26)*
  - Scalar PDTP predicts breathing mode GWs; LIGO confirms tensor (+ and ×) modes
  - **Key insight:** Part 21 oscillator lattice already has shear rigidity
  - Lattices support transverse (shear) waves → these ARE the tensor modes
  - Scalar PDTP has been using only the longitudinal branch of the lattice
  - Two transverse branches contain the missing tensor GW polarizations
  - Required condition: shear modulus μ = bulk modulus B = v² (gives c_T = c)
  - Three approaches identified: tetrad extension, lattice shear modes, elastic condensate
  - **Most promising:** extract all three wave branches from the Part 21 lattice
  - This is a mathematical completion task, not a conceptual redesign
  - See [scalar_vs_tensor_gravity.md](docs/research/scalar_vs_tensor_gravity.md)

- [x] **Phase-locking as universal force mechanism** *(Part 27b — 2026-02-26)*
  - All forces reframed as cosine phase-coupling at different strengths:
    gravity g cos(ψ−φ), strong gₛ cos(ψ₁−ψ₂), EM gₑ cos(ψ−A)
  - Quarks as standing waves; gluons as phase-locking oscillations (not particles)
  - 3 quarks at 120° phase spacing = colour singlet = Z₃ phase cancellation
  - Confinement = uncancelled phase costs energy ∝ distance (linear potential)
  - Proton Lagrangian written: 3 strong couplings + 3 gravitational couplings
  - Coupling hierarchy reframed (not solved): gₛ ≈ 1, gₑ ≈ 1/137, g ≈ 10⁻⁴⁰
  - **Key gap:** SU(3) gauge structure (8 gluons, asymptotic freedom) not yet
    derived from phase lattice — biggest challenge for this approach
  - Investigation roadmap: 120° stability proof, linear confinement, SU(3) emergence
  - **Extended (Part 27b update):** lattice modes mapped to particle spin
    (l=0 → spin-0, l=1 → spin-1, l=2 → spin-2 = graviton); hydrogen orbital
    shapes (s,p,d,f) = same mathematics as condensate mode patterns;
    longitudinal + transverse = circular polarization (↻); × mode = + mode
    rotated 45°; spin-2 graviton = 180° periodicity of quadrupole deformation;
    4th lattice mode (internal rotation/torsion) could be EM (open question,
    connects to Kaluza-Klein); spacetime and EM currently separate fields in
    PDTP but lattice internal modes are a candidate for unification
  - See [phase_locking_unification.md](docs/research/phase_locking_unification.md)

- [ ] **Investigate: SU(3) gauge structure from phase lattice** *(Future — from Part 27b)*
  - Can 8 gluon modes emerge as normal modes of the quark-condensate system?
  - Does asymptotic freedom (coupling weaker at high energy) follow from phase-locking?
  - Can linear confinement (energy ∝ distance) be derived from phase string tension?
  - Can SU(2) weak structure emerge from Z₂ matter/antimatter phase symmetry?
  - Ultimate test: derive ALL coupling constants from single condensate parameter
  - **Depends on:** Part 23 (colour as Z₃ phase), Part 27b (universal coupling)

- [x] **Derive tensor GW modes from oscillator lattice** *(Part 28 — 2026-02-27)*
  - Vector lattice (3 DOF/site) gives 3 wave branches: 2 transverse + 1 longitudinal
  - **Key finding:** central-force lattice gives Cauchy relation λ = μ → c_T = c/√3 (fails LIGO)
  - Resolution: angular (non-central) forces break Cauchy relation → c_T = c when μ = κ
  - Condition for tensor GW speed = c: μ_shear = κ = c²/(4πG) ≈ 1.07 × 10²⁶ Pa
  - Transverse modes map to h₊ and h× polarizations; breathing mode is massive (gap from cos coupling)
  - Strain-metric correspondence: elastic shear wave eq → □h^TT = 0 (linearized Einstein eq)
  - Matches Part 12 (tetrad extension) exactly: E(2) class N₃ (2 tensor + 1 breathing)
  - **Honest finding:** central forces alone don't work; angular forces = spin connection physics
  - **Remaining:** specific angular potential, quadrupole formula, G prefactor resolution
  - See [tensor_gw_lattice.md](docs/research/tensor_gw_lattice.md)

- [x] **Substitution chain analysis: derive K or G from known equations** *(Part 29 — 2026-02-28)*
  - Ran 8 substitution chains (Gravitational+EM, Planck units, BH thermodynamics,
    Schwarzschild, Compton+gravity, Friedmann, fine structure+gravitational, EoS)
  - **Key result: ALL 8 chains reduce to κ = c²/(4πG) — algebraic circularity proven**
  - Circularity is fundamental: 1 equation (bridge), 2 unknowns (κ, G) → cannot derive G
  - Historical parallels: same circularity hit Newton's G (resolved by Cavendish), c (elevated
    to postulate by Einstein), G_F (resolved by electroweak unification)
  - Four strategies identified: (A) independent κ measurement, (B) derive hierarchy ratio
    R = α_G/α_EM ~ 10⁻³⁷, (C) emergent G from GFT microphysics, (D) postulate K = ℏ/(4πc)
  - Promising lead: K = ℏ/(4πc) = 2.80×10⁻⁴⁴ J (uses only ℏ and c, no G)
  - Condensate density ρ ~ 10⁹ kg/m³ (white dwarf), NOT Planck density (10⁹⁷ kg/m³)
  - Decoupling energy: ~10 kW for 1 ton (~13 hp) — bottleneck is mechanism, not energy
  - **Strategic conclusion:** stop substitution attempts; focus on vacuum dispersion,
    breathing mode detection, and hierarchy ratio derivation

- [x] **Investigate: polarization as unifying language across EM, colour, and GW sectors** *(Part 28b — 2026-02-27)*
  - **Observation:** an EM wave viewed head-on (along propagation axis) shows the
    field vector tracing a circle (if circularly polarized) or oscillating linearly —
    visually resembling the scalar breathing mode of the PDTP lattice
  - **Reference images:**
    - [Circular polarization of EM wave](../assets/images/waves%20polorization/licensed-image%20Circular%20polarization%20of%20n%20electromagnetic%20wave.jpg) — E-vector rotates; head-on view traces a circle
    - [EM wave components](../assets/images/waves%20polorization/licensed-image%20electromatnetic%20waves.jpg) — E and H perpendicular, both transverse to propagation
    - [Polarization filters](../assets/images/waves%20polorization/licensed-image%20polrization.jpg) — selective transmission by orientation; crossed filters → opaque
  - **Key questions to investigate rigorously:**
    1. **LIGO as GW polarization filter:** LIGO's Michelson geometry measures
       differential arm strain (ΔL/L). A breathing mode (isotropic expansion)
       changes both arms equally → differential signal ≈ 0. Is LIGO geometrically
       blind to scalar GW modes? (Standard result: yes — see Eardley et al. 1973,
       Will 1993 "Theory and Experiment in Gravitational Physics")
       What detector geometry would be sensitive to breathing modes? (Triangular
       detectors like LISA, or pulsar timing arrays, have partial scalar sensitivity)
    2. **α = cos(ψ − φ) as polarization projection:** in Malus's law, transmitted
       intensity I = I₀ cos²θ where θ is the angle between polarizer and light
       polarization. PDTP's coupling α = cos(ψ − φ) has the same structure.
       Question: is this analogy superficial (both are just cosines) or structural
       (does the phase angle ψ − φ formally act as a polarization angle in some
       representation)? Must distinguish mathematical similarity from physical
       equivalence — cosine projections appear everywhere in physics
    3. **Colour confinement as forced depolarization:** three quarks at 0°, 120°,
       240° in phase space sum to zero (Z₃ singlet). This is analogous to three
       equal vectors at 120° summing to zero → "unpolarized" colour state.
       Question: can this be made rigorous? The actual QCD confinement mechanism
       involves the Wilson loop area law and non-perturbative vacuum — does the
       phase-cancellation picture reduce to or approximate this in any limit?
       **Caution:** superficial pattern-matching with confinement is a known trap
       in alternative frameworks; must engage with actual SU(3) lattice gauge theory
    4. **Spacetime "polarization":** the PDTP lattice has 3 displacement DOF per
       site (2 transverse + 1 longitudinal). Near a mass, the longitudinal mode
       dominates (scalar gravity). In a GW, transverse modes dominate. Question:
       is there a meaningful sense in which curved spacetime is "polarized" toward
       the longitudinal sector? Does the mass distribution act as a polarization
       filter for lattice modes?
    5. **Phase decoupling as orthogonal polarization:** if α = cos(ψ − φ) → 0
       at ψ − φ = π/2, this is like crossed polarizers blocking all light.
       Question: what physical mechanism could rotate ψ relative to φ by 90°?
       What energy cost does this require? (Connects to Part 29 engineering goal)
  - **Rigour requirements:**
    - Every analogy must be tested: does the math actually map, or is it just
      a visual similarity? Malus's law is I ∝ cos²θ (squared); PDTP coupling
      is α = cos(ψ−φ) (linear) — these are different. Must resolve this
    - EM polarization is a vector property (spin-1); GW polarization is tensor
      (spin-2); colour is an internal SU(3) quantum number — these live in
      different mathematical spaces. The analogy must respect this or explicitly
      state where it breaks down
    - "Looks like" is not "is equivalent to" — every claim needs either a
      formal mapping or an honest statement that it remains speculative
  - **Potential payoff:** if the polarization language is more than analogy,
    it suggests a representation-theoretic unification: all forces as different
    representations of phase-space rotations, with coupling = projection onto
    the interaction axis. This would connect to Wigner's classification of
    particles by representations of the Poincaré group
  - **Depends on:** Part 28 (lattice modes), Part 27b (universal phase-locking),
    Part 12 (tetrad extension)

- [x] **Falsifiable predictions document** *(2026-02-28)*
  - 6 predictions that differ from GR, each with confirm/kill criteria
  - Ranked by testability: dark energy w(z) most testable now, Planck dispersion least
  - Critical path: DESI confirms w₀>−1 → Part 29 determines ω_gap → high-freq detector finds breathing mode
  - Key gap: breathing mode mass ω_gap unknown until Part 29 completes
  - See [falsifiable_predictions.md](docs/research/falsifiable_predictions.md)

- [x] **Wave effects catalog and PDTP connections** *(Part 28c — 2026-02-28)*
  - All 50 standard wave phenomena mapped to PDTP framework
  - Section 1: complete catalog of wave types, properties, and effects
  - Section 2: PDTP connection for each effect with confidence rating
  - Scorecard: 27 high confidence, 15 medium, 8 low (speculative/open)
  - Key insight: several "different" GR phenomena are the same wave effect in PDTP
    (lensing = refraction, horizons = total internal reflection, redshift = Doppler,
    dark energy = beats)
  - New predictions identified: Cherenkov breathing mode, L↔T mode conversion
  - See [wave_effects_pdtp.md](docs/research/wave_effects_pdtp.md)

- [ ] **Scalar sector backreaction on tensor sector**
  - Does the scalar sector modify the effective T_μν seen by the tensor sector?
  - If φ dynamics change the condensate stress-energy, this could feed back
    into the Einstein equation through modified G or effective Λ
  - Could bridge the gap between scalar (vacuum-insensitive) and tensor
    (vacuum-sensitive) sectors
  - Related to whether G varies dynamically through condensate evolution

### Black Holes in PDTP

- [ ] **Black hole singularity as topological defect**
  - Standard GR: r=0 singularity (curvature → ∞, classical divide-by-zero)
  - In PDTP: phase θ is periodic (θ mod 2π), gradients bounded by lattice spacing a ~ ℓ_Planck
  - r=0 is replaced by a vortex core: a topological defect with finite energy density
    (analogous to a superfluid vortex, where the core has finite healing length ξ)
  - Needs: formal treatment of condensate structure at r < ℓ_Planck; what replaces the
    curvature singularity in the PDTP picture?
  - Possible resolution: Penrose singularity theorems assume continuous manifold — lattice
    cutoff evades them (similar to LQC bounce)

- [ ] **Hawking radiation information paradox in PDTP condensate**
  - Standard paradox: Hawking radiation is thermal (random) → information about infalling
    matter appears lost, violating unitarity
  - PDTP angle: infalling matter perturbs the condensate phase field φ; these phase
    perturbations propagate outward as phonons — phase correlations persist outside horizon
  - Question: do exterior condensate phase correlations encode the phase pattern of
    infalling matter? (analogous to superfluid vortex retaining circulation information)
  - May be testable in analogue systems (sonic black holes in BECs — Steinhauer 2016)
  - Status: speculative — requires explicit calculation of phase correlations in condensate

- [ ] **Black hole evaporation endpoint in PDTP**
  - As BH evaporates: M decreases → T_H = ℏc³/(8πGMk_B) increases → evaporation
    accelerates → M → M_Planck
  - At M ~ M_Planck: condensate picture breaks down (BH radius ~ lattice spacing ~ ℓ_Planck)
  - What replaces the classical singularity in the final state? Topological defect?
    Phase soliton? Complete decoherence of the condensate locally?
  - Status: genuinely open — requires full lattice-scale condensate theory (GFT/LQG)

### Standard Model Mapping

- [x] **Part 22: Antimatter as Opposite-Winding Topological Defects** *(Part 22 — 2026-02-28)*
  - Antiparticle = opposite winding number (−1) vs particle (+1)
  - BEC vortex-antivortex physics as physical precedent
  - Two competing models clarified: Model A (winding) ≠ Model B (trough equilibrium)
    - Model A = topological (global charge) — the QFT antiparticle
    - Model B = dynamical (local stability) — a different object (domain excitation)
  - Annihilation as winding cancellation → energy 2g = 2mc² per pair
  - CPT symmetry verified: Lagrangian is separately C, P, T invariant
  - CP violation absent → blocks Sakharov baryogenesis (honest limitation)
  - Antimatter gravity: g_anti/g = 1.000 predicted, consistent with ALPHA-g 2023
  - Key gaps: CP violation, positronium lifetime, formal vortex solution
  - See [antimatter_topological_defects.md](docs/research/antimatter_topological_defects.md)

- [x] **Part 23: Charge, Color, Hadrons, and Quantum Numbers in PDTP** *(Part 23 — 2026-02-23)*
  - Electric charge: U(1) symmetry + winding number interpretation
  - Fractional charges: Z₃ structure, partial topological cycles
  - Hadrons: baryons (3 quarks = complete cycle) and mesons (quark+antiquark)
  - Color as phase position (0, 2π/3, 4π/3) in condensate wave
  - Confinement = completing the wave cycle (3 × 1/3 = integer)
  - Gluons as condensate phase transfer between partial defects

  - Combined Lagrangian: L_total = L_spacetime + L_SM + L_PDTP_gravity
  - Higgs ↔ PDTP condensate structural parallel identified
  - Mass hierarchy reframed as coupling hierarchy (not solved)
  - Honest conclusion: PDTP adds gravity as phase-locking, preserves all SM
    gauge structure unchanged. Mapping is interpretive, not predictive.

### Microphysics Priority (from external review)

These items target the keystone open problem: condensate microphysics.
Strategic priority: derive κ → G from first principles.

- [x] **Energy-Frequency-Vibration microphysics approach** *(Part 21 — 2026-02-22)*
  - Tesla-inspired framework: assume universe = energy, frequency, vibration
  - Defined E/F/V rigorously in established physics AND PDTP
  - Built oscillator lattice Hamiltonian: H = Σ(I/2)(∂ₜθ)² + (K/2)Σ(θᵢ−θⱼ)²
  - Derived: c² = κ/ρ, G = c²/(4πκ), M_eff = (ρ/3)∫(∇θ₀)²d³x
  - Cosine coupling derived from |Φ−Ψ|² symmetry breaking: g = 2λ√(ρσ)
  - Lattice parameters computed: K ≈ 5.78 × 10⁻¹⁰ J, I ≈ 5.03 × 10⁻⁹⁶ kg·m²
  - Constraint check: 5/10 (scalar model; tensor constraints need Part 12)
  - Isolated from main PDTP — exploratory microphysics document
  - See [efv_microphysics.md](docs/research/efv_microphysics.md)

- [x] **Derive cosine coupling from symmetry breaking** *(Part 21 — 2026-02-22)*
  - Started with complex fields Φ = √ρ e^{iφ}, Ψ = √σ e^{iψ}
  - Expanded |Φ − Ψ|² = ρ + σ − 2√(ρσ) cos(ψ − φ)
  - Cosine coupling emerges naturally with g = 2λ√(ρσ)
  - Status: plausibility argument (choice of |Φ−Ψ|² needs justification)

- [x] **Derive phase stiffness κ from condensate equation of state**
  - κ = v² (condensate order parameter squared) — from Goldstone effective Lagrangian
  - Equals bulk modulus B = ρ_mass × c_s² = ρ_mass × c² for a c_s = c condensate
  - Compressibility χ_s = 4πG/c² (extraordinarily small — gravity weak ↔ condensate stiff)
  - G = c²/(4πv²): Newton's constant set by inverse square of the condensate vev
  - Remaining open: what sets v? Requires μ and λ from microscopic theory (GFT, Part 14)
  - See [efv_microphysics.md](docs/research/efv_microphysics.md) §8.7

- [x] **Derive inertial mass–frequency relation explicitly** *(Part 21 — 2026-02-22)*
  - Derived M_eff = (ρ/3)∫(∇θ₀)²d³x from moving defect kinetic energy
  - Rest energy E₀ = M_eff c², Compton frequency ω₀ = M_eff c²/ℏ
  - Mass = localized frequency detuning = integrated phase distortion energy
  - Structural win: mass is emergent, not fundamental (polaron/soliton analogy)

- [x] **Oscillator lattice Hamiltonian for spacetime** *(Part 21 — 2026-02-22)*
  - Minimal discrete model: H = Σ(I/2)(∂ₜθ)² + (K/2)Σ(θᵢ−θⱼ)²
  - Continuum limit with careful dimensional analysis: ℋ = (ρ/2)(∂ₜθ)² + (κ/2)(∇θ)²
  - Derived c² = κ/ρ, G = c²/(4πκ), M_eff = (ρ/3)∫(∇θ₀)²d³x
  - GFT connection noted (Part 14) — tetrahedra as possible oscillators

### Refraction as Universal Phase-Locking Mechanism (Speculative — Needs Consistency Check)

- [x] **Phase refraction as the physical mechanism for gravity and atomic binding** *(Part 31 — 2026-03-01)*
  - **Core idea:** gravity and atomic binding are both wave refraction in phase media of different densities
  - Gravity = refraction of matter waves (Part 28c, confirmed)
  - EM binding = refraction with coupling g_EM = 27.2 eV (Hartree energy), 10^39 times stronger than gravity
  - **Two-coupling problem identified:** gravitational g ~ 10^-40 eV vs EM g_EM ~ 27 eV — same mechanism, vastly different strength = the hierarchy problem restated in refraction language
  - **Calculation 1 (KG → Schrödinger):** PDTP wave equation reduces to Schrödinger in non-relativistic limit — compatibility confirmed (standard result, not new)
  - **Calculation 2 (critical angle):** Ionization angle is **60°, NOT 90°** (virial theorem for 1/r potentials)
    - 60° = ionization threshold (cos = 0.5, E = g_EM/2 = 13.6 eV)
    - 90° = total decoupling (cos = 0, E = g_EM = 27.2 eV)
    - The simple "critical angle = 90°" picture FAILS for ionization — informative failure
  - **Calculation 3 (angular momentum):** sin(θ) = √(l(l+1))/n correctly classifies orbital geometry (whispering gallery analogy) — qualitative match, not a derivation
  - **Sudoku scorecard:** 11/11 tests pass for g_EM = Hartree energy
  - **Gravitational Bohr radius:** a_G = ℏ²/(G m_e² m_p) = 1.2 × 10²⁹ m (larger than observable universe) — gravity too weak to form atoms at quantum scales
  - **Honest conclusion:** unified physical picture (interpretive), not predictive; no new predictions beyond standard QM; hierarchy problem restated, not solved
  - See [phase_refraction_analysis.md](docs/research/phase_refraction_analysis.md)

### Breaking the Circularity (from Part 29 follow-up)

- [x] **Sudoku consistency check: test K = ℏ/(4πc) with candidate lattice spacings** *(Part 30a — 2026-03-01)*
  - Assumed K = ℏ/(4πc) (G-free), tested 3 candidates for lattice spacing a:
    - Planck length (control): 10/10 matches — recovers all physics exactly (circular)
    - Electron Compton wavelength: 0/10 — off by 10^45 everywhere
    - Proton Compton wavelength: 0/10 — off by 10^38 everywhere
  - Bonus tests: geometric mean, harmonic mean, Bohr radius, α_EM scaling — all fail
  - No clean integer power of α_EM fixes it (n = 10.47 for electron, 8.95 for proton)
  - **Key finding:** correction factor = (m_particle/m_Planck)² exactly for both particles
  - **Insight:** the Sudoku error IS the hierarchy problem — deriving G from particle masses
    requires solving the hierarchy problem first
  - Reverse engineering always gives a = l_P — algebraic identity, not coincidence

  - Full output: [sudoku_consistency_output.md](simulations/sudoku_consistency_output.md)

- [x] **Research external frameworks for deriving G** *(Part 30b — 2026-03-01)*
  - How do non-PDTP frameworks derive G? Survey of 8 approaches:
    - Sakharov induced gravity: G ~ 1/(N_eff × Λ²) — most promising for PDTP
    - String theory: G₄ = 8π⁶ g_s² l_s⁸ / V₆ — genuine derivation, but landscape problem
    - Volovik superfluid: G_eff from condensate (ρ, c_s, ξ) — formally non-circular
    - All others (LQG, CDT, causal sets, entropic gravity): G is input
  - **No framework derives G from purely non-gravitational measurements**
  - Best strategy: Sakharov + Volovik hybrid — breathing mode → ω_gap → κ → G

- [x] **Apply Sakharov's induced gravity formula to PDTP lattice** *(Part 30b — 2026-03-01)*
  - Sakharov (Visser 2002): 1/(16πG) = N_eff × Λ²/(16π²)
  - SM content: N_eff = 49/30 ≈ 1.63 (vectors dominate: +2.07, fermions: −0.47, scalars: +0.03)
  - Required Λ for correct G: Λ = 1.39 × M_Planck → CIRCULAR
  - PDTP lattice: a = sqrt(N_eff × π) × l_P for all N_eff values → still Planck scale
  - Sakharov + PDTP gives new bridge: G = a²/(N_eff × π × ℏ × c)
  - **Cleanly separates two unknowns:** lattice spacing `a` and mode count `N_eff`
  - String theory mapping: G ∝ g_s² × l_s² (string coupling × string length)
  - PDTP analogue: G = c²/(4πv²) where v = condensate VEV → same structure
  - **Honest result:** circularity is UNIVERSAL — every framework trades G for other unknowns

- [x] **Breathing mode gap energy analysis** *(Part 30b — 2026-03-01)*
  - E_gap = sqrt(2 × ℏc × E_Planck) ≈ 69.4 GeV (geometric mean model)
  - Remarkably close to electroweak scale: E_gap/m_W = 0.86, E_gap/m_H = 0.55
  - If this is physical (not coincidence), the hierarchy problem IS the breathing mode mass problem
  - Simplest lattice model gives E_gap = sqrt(2) × E_Planck (too high) — model-dependent

- [x] **Dvali species bound applied to PDTP** *(Part 30b — 2026-03-01)*
  - M_P² = N_s × Λ_species² (Dvali 2007)
  - SM has ~118 DOF → Λ_species ≈ 10¹⁸ GeV (still Planck-ish)
  - To get Λ_species ~ electroweak: need N_s ~ 10³² species
  - For Λ_species ~ 1 GeV (nuclear): need N_s ~ 10³⁸ (= α_G/α_EM hierarchy!)
  - **Open question:** does the PDTP lattice have ~10³² modes per Planck volume?

- [ ] **Derive hierarchy ratio R = α_G/α_EM from lattice structure**
  - From Chain 7: if R ~ 10⁻³⁷ can be derived, G follows from particle physics alone
  - Dvali species bound: M_P² = N_s × Λ_species² — could N_s come from PDTP?
  - String theory: R related to compactification geometry — any PDTP analogue?
  - Sakharov clearest path: determine N_eff (lattice symmetry) + a (breathing mode) independently

- [x] **Part 32: Koide-lattice analysis — use particle masses as input to constrain K and G** *(2026-03-01)*
  - **Result:** 0/8 non-circular candidates pass (2 passes are circular — use G)
  - **Key finding 1:** G_pred from electron Compton wavelength = (m_Pl/m_e)² × G_known (N=2.00 exactly)
    — the hierarchy problem stated in its purest form
  - **Key finding 2:** Koide base mass M₀ = μ² = 313.84 MeV ≈ m_proton/3 (constituent quark mass, 0.3% match)
    — non-trivial coincidence worth tracking; may hint at lepton-QCD connection via shared lattice mode
  - **Key finding 3:** The 3×3 circulant mass matrix naturally produces the Brannen eigenspectrum —
    tight-binding ring lattice with μ on-site and μ/√2 hopping gives exactly the three lepton masses
  - **Key finding 4:** Koide formula is a STRUCTURE theorem (mass ratios), not a SCALE theorem.
    The "Maxwell term" cannot come from the mass spectrum alone; it requires one of:
    - Breathing mode measurement: ω_gap → a → G (Strategy A, independent of G)
    - Hierarchy ratio R = α_G/α_EM from lattice topology (Strategy B)
    - Dvali species counting: N_s ~ 10³² modes/Planck volume → gravity weak by counting
  - **Quark sector:** each quark triplet gives a different M₀ (94× or 2× lepton M₀) — no universal value
    QCD corrections likely distort quark masses from their "bare" Koide values

    a = l_P × (m_e/m_P)^p1 × (m_p/m_P)^p2 × alpha^p3 found:
    Best non-circular: p1=−1, p2=+1, p3=+1.5 gives G_pred/G_known = 1.31 (0.12 decades off)
    — dramatically better than Part 32 best (10^44 off), but still uses l_P (circular)
  - **Analytical proof:** The constraint equation for G_pred = G_known has infinitely
    many solutions in (p1,p2,p3), but all reduce to a = l_P = sqrt(hbar*G/c^3).
    The circularity is algebraically proven for this parametric family.

## Status

```
Mathematical formalization complete (three parts + follow-up).

Part 1: Lagrangian, field equations, conservation laws, stability,
Newtonian recovery, order-of-magnitude predictions.

Part 2: Quantum φ definition (superfluid vacuum), post-Newtonian corrections,
Standard Model integration, experimental test design.

Part 3: GW polarization (emergent tensor + breathing mode), PPN parameters
(γ=1, β=1), vacuum condensate constraints (GFT connection), photon coupling
(indirect via acoustic metric, factor-of-2 recovered).

Part 3b (follow-up): κ=−2 derived (PG representation), breathing mode
amplitude quantified (<10⁻⁵), tetrad structure analyzed (extension needed),
G_EM resolved (removed — trace problem). Field equation simplified.

All "Remaining Questions" from Part 3 addressed.
Part 4: Koide formula derived from Z₃ phase harmonic geometry. Proved
Q = 2/3 ⟺ δ = √2. Extended to quarks: (c,b,t) near-Koide. Physical
origin of δ = √2 from equal energy partition. θ₀ = 2/9 remains empirical.

Koide stretch goal completed.
Part 5: Fine-structure constant analyzed as impedance ratio. α = Z₀/(2R_K)
exact identity. Impedance mismatch interpretation, length scale hierarchy,
running coupling, Wyler's formula. Numerical value NOT derived — requires
condensate microscopic structure (open in SVT itself).

Fine-structure constant stretch goal completed (structural analysis).
Part 6: Emergent GR simulation. Five independent numerical tests: 1/r
potential recovery (Thomas algorithm, 1.35% err), smooth curvature emergence
from N=10–1000 discrete oscillators (0.44% err), Kuramoto synchronization
(R: 0.329→1.000), two-body 1/d force law (exponent −0.984), weak-field
linearization validation (machine-precision match to |1−sin(x)/x|).
Runtime ~10s. All tests PASS.

Simulation stretch goal completed.
Part 7: Free photon gravity analysis. Quantitative assessment: solar
deficit ~10⁻²¹/s, thermal suppression ~10⁻¹⁴, trace anomaly ~0.04%.
Key insight: radiation dominates only when tightly coupled (pre-
recombination), and free-streams only when subdominant. Problem is
cosmological, not astrophysical. Plasma frequency effective mass as
possible pre-recombination coupling mechanism.

Free photon analysis completed.
Part 8: Radiation-era cosmology. Matter-era Friedmann equation derived
from condensate dynamics (Euler + continuity). Tight-coupling argument
resolves photon contribution (effective mass). Genuine gap: decoupled
neutrino kinetic energy at BBN (41% of ρ_total, 23% error in H).
Requires acoustic metric tensor channel for full resolution.

Radiation-era cosmology analysis completed.
Part 9: Newton's constant G derivation. Dimensional analysis gives
G = 𝒞 c^(5/2)/√(ℏρ₀), exact when ρ₀ = ρ_Planck. Coupling constants
gᵢ shown to be geometric (~4πRᵢ), not free parameters. Reduces N+2
apparent parameters to 1 unknown (𝒞). Energy-cost circularity resolved.
Full derivation requires condensate microphysics (deepest open problem).

G derivation completed (partial — one free parameter remains).
Part 10: Strong-field equivalence principle. Phase difference = compactness
parameter: δψ = GM/(Rc²). Nonlinearity sin(δψ)/δψ is 0.7% for NS, 4.1%
at BH horizon. Strong-field Nordtvedt η ~ Ξ²/6. Binding energy gravitates
correctly to O(Ξ). Acoustic horizon at r = 2GM/c² (exact). Tension with
double pulsar Ṗ_b at ~1% level — critical open question.

Strong-field EP analysis completed.
Part 11: Momentum balance for phase-gradient motion. Derived local force
density F^k_j = −gⱼ sin(ψⱼ−φ) ∂^k ψⱼ. Two worked examples: test particle
(field absorbs recoil) and two-body (field as intermediary). Newton's F=mg
recovered. "Reactionless drive" resolved: propellant-free but momentum-
conserving. Earth–Sun budget: field momentum ~10⁻⁸ of matter momenta.

Momentum balance completed.
Part 12: Condensate tetrad extension. Extended order parameter
Φ = √ρ₀ e^{iφ} e^a_μ. Palatini + phase-coupling Lagrangian. Four field
equations derived. Linearized analysis: 2 tensor modes (□h^TT = 0) +
1 massive breathing mode. E(2) class N₃. All Parts 1–11 preserved.
Symmetry breaking GL(4,R)×U(1) → SO(3,1). Frame-dragging, Kerr metric
recovered. GFT condensate as microscopic origin candidate.

Tetrad extension completed.
Part 13: Double pulsar tension resolution. The ~1.5% GW emission deficit
was an artifact of scalar-only PDTP. In extended PDTP (Part 12), dominant
GW emission is through tensor modes (Einstein equation → quadrupole formula
= GR). Global U(1) symmetry (φ→φ+c, ψ→ψ+c) guarantees scalar charge
α_A = 0 for all bodies → zero scalar radiation. Result: Ṗ_b^PDTP = Ṗ_b^GR
exactly. Spontaneous scalarization ruled out (β_A = 0). All binary pulsar
tests consistent.

Double pulsar tension resolved.
Part 14: Condensate microphysics analysis. 10 constraints compiled from
Parts 1–13. 5 candidate theories compared: GFT is best candidate (7/10).
GFT-PDTP dictionary constructed. Downstream blockage analysis: all
phenomenological predictions independent of microphysics (universality).
Three missing links for GFT derivation identified. Research roadmap
provided. Status: genuinely open — thorough analysis, no resolution claimed.

Condensate microphysics analysis completed.
Part 15: Neutrino BBN resolution via tetrad extension. The 41% neutrino
energy deficit at BBN was an artifact of scalar-only PDTP — the same
pattern as the double pulsar tension (Part 13). Extended PDTP (Part 12)
derives Einstein equation G_μν = 8πG T_μν, whose (0,0) component gives
the Friedmann equation with ALL energy density including ρ_ν. The tensor
sector uses T_00 (not the trace T = 0), so neutrinos contribute fully.
Result: H²_PDTP = H²_GR at all epochs. Two-sector cosmological structure:
tensor handles all energy-momentum, scalar provides phase-locking mechanism.

Neutrino BBN problem resolved.
Part 16: Hubble tension analysis. Developed quantitative model of
environment-dependent phase drift rate. Two mechanisms analyzed:
(1) direct scalar drift (1/ρ dependence) — Cassini bound ε_s < 10⁻⁵
makes this negligible; (2) backreaction from phase inhomogeneity —
σ²_δψ ~ 10⁻¹⁰, also negligible. Both mechanisms ~9 orders of magnitude
too small. Honest conclusion: PDTP cannot currently explain the 8% H₀
discrepancy. Deep connection identified between Hubble tension, dark
energy, and phase drift mechanism (common root in condensate coherence
evolution). Conditional predictions provided for future surveys.

Hubble tension analysis completed (genuinely open — no resolution claimed).

Part 17: Cosmological constant / dark energy analysis. Scalar sector
phase-filters vacuum fluctuations (⟨sin(ψ_vac − φ)⟩ = 0 for random phases).
ρ₀ vs ρ_Λ reframing: dark energy = condensate perturbation δρ₀/ρ₀ ~ 10⁻¹²³.
Phase drift → dynamical dark energy with w ≠ −1 (qualitatively consistent
with DESI DR2 4.2σ evidence for evolving dark energy). Tensor sector inherits
GR's full cosmological constant problem (G_μν = 8πG T_μν includes vacuum
energy). Honest conclusion: partial reframing with genuinely novel scalar
sector mechanism, but not a solution. Common root with Hubble tension
(Part 16) and phase drift mechanism — all require condensate microphysics.

Cosmological constant analysis completed (partial reframing — not solved).

Part 18: Aharonov-Bohm effect and PDTP phase structure — deep analysis.
COW experiment derivation: PDTP reproduces Δφ = (m/ℏ)∫Φdt exactly via
weak-field limit (consistency check, not new prediction). Overstreet et al.
(2022, Science) observed gravitational AB phase shift with atom interferometry
— strongest experimental support for PDTP's phase-centric paradigm. Fiber
bundle classification: PDTP = U(1)_global × SO(3,1) product bundle (trivial
scalar bundle for phase dynamics + GR frame bundle for spacetime geometry).
Topological defects: cosmic strings interpreted as quantized vortex lines
in condensate phase field (∮∇φ·dl = 2πn ↔ deficit angle Δθ = 8πGμ/c²).
EM–gravity parallel: both involve phase coupling, but gauging PDTP's U(1)
does NOT naturally produce electromagnetism (coupling constant mismatch,
charge structure incompatible). Impact assessment: no modifications to
previous Parts needed — geometric consistency confirmed. Speculative:
cosmological vortex networks could relate to phase drift (Part 17).

Aharonov-Bohm deep analysis completed (geometric consistency confirmed).

Part 19: Phase drift mechanism — deep analysis of why spacetime phase
de-synchronizes at cosmic scales. Four candidate mechanisms analyzed:
(1) finite coherence length ξ = c/√(2g) as primary mechanism — exponential
decay of phase correlations beyond ξ explains the ~100 Mpc transition;
(2) cosmological expansion stretches condensate wavelength, accumulating
frequency mismatch; (3) thermal fluctuations map to Landau two-fluid model
— dark energy as normal fraction (universe deep in superfluid phase,
T ≪ T_c); (4) topological defects via Kibble-Zurek mechanism — primordial
vortex networks set effective coherence scale. Key result: effective
Langevin equation δφ̈ + 3H(t)δφ̇ + g_eff(t)δφ = η(t) unifies all four
mechanisms. Qualitative w(z) matches DESI DR2 (w₀ > −1, w_a < 0) via
overdamped → resonant → relaxation dynamics. Honest conclusion: framework
analysis, not solution — quantitative predictions blocked by unknown
condensate microphysics (g, T_cond, n_vortex, γ_micro).

Phase drift mechanism analysis completed (framework established).

All formalization tasks (Parts 1–21) and stretch goals completed.

Part 20: Standard Model and PDTP particle-force mapping. Systematic side-by-side
comparison of all 17 SM particles and 4 forces with PDTP interpretations. Key
finding: PDTP adds gravity (phase-locking) while preserving the entire SM gauge
structure (SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1)) unchanged. Complete particle table with coupling
constant estimates. Combined Lagrangian L_total written. Higgs ↔ PDTP condensate
parallel identified. Mass hierarchy reframed as coupling hierarchy. Honest
conclusion: mapping is interpretive, not predictive — no new particle physics
predictions. Strategic assessment: confirms external review recommendation to
focus on microphysics as the keystone problem.

Part 21: Energy-Frequency-Vibration condensate microphysics (exploratory, isolated
from main PDTP). Tesla-inspired premise: universe = energy, frequency, vibration.
Built oscillator lattice Hamiltonian H = Σ(I/2)(∂ₜθ)² + (K/2)Σ(θᵢ−θⱼ)². Derived:
c² = κ/ρ (speed of light = stiffness/inertia), G = c²/(4πκ) (gravity = inverse
stiffness), M_eff = (ρ/3)∫(∇θ₀)²d³x (mass = phase distortion energy). Cosine
coupling derived from |Φ−Ψ|² symmetry breaking: g = 2λ√(ρσ). Lattice parameters
computed from known G: K ≈ 5.78 × 10⁻¹⁰ J. Constraint satisfaction: 5/10 (scalar
model limitation — tensor constraints require Part 12 extension). Honest conclusion:
framework for G derivation established, but true first-principles prediction requires
independent determination of lattice coupling K.

All formalization tasks (Parts 1–21) and stretch goals completed.
Open problems documented in "Open Problems (Future Work)" section:
- Cosmological: phase drift mechanism analyzed (Part 19) — framework established,
  quantitative predictions still require condensate microphysics
- Structural: vacuum energy tensor sector, temperature model, w(z) derivation,
  scalar-tensor backreaction (from external review of Part 17)
- Microphysics priority: EFV approach completed (Part 21), cosine coupling derived
  (plausibility), oscillator lattice built, mass-frequency derived. Remaining:
  phase stiffness κ from first principles (deepest gap), tensor lattice extension
- Topological: vortex dynamics in PDTP condensate, condensate phase transition

Part 25: Dark energy w(z) from phase drift dynamics. Derived CPL parametrization:
w_a = −(1−w₀²)/2 × (m + 3Ω_m) for g_eff ∝ a^m. DE-tracking coupling (m=3)
gives 0.4σ match to DESI DR2. Consistency line R = m + 3Ω_m is falsifiable.
Phantom bound w ≥ −1 is a hard constraint from canonical scalar.

Part 26: Free parameter m analysis. Derived self-consistency condition m = 6ε
(most robust internal prediction: m ≈ 0.57). Dynamical scaling gives m ≈ 2.
Honest finding: m = 3 was phenomenological curve-fitting, not a derivation.
The non-constant ε(a) integral is the most promising route to larger m values.

Part 27: Scalar vs tensor gravity analysis. Identified the single biggest gap
(breathing mode vs LIGO tensor modes) AND the path to closing it: the Part 21
oscillator lattice already has shear rigidity → supports transverse waves →
these are the tensor GW modes. Extracting all three lattice wave branches is
the highest-priority next task (Part 28).

Part 27b: Phase-locking as universal force mechanism. All forces reframed as
cosine phase-coupling: gravity (matter↔spacetime), strong (quark↔quark), EM
(charge↔field). Same equation L = g cos(ψ₁−ψ₂), different coupling strength.
Quarks as standing waves, gluons as phase anchors (coupling patterns, not
particles). 3 quarks at 120° = colour singlet via Z₃ phase cancellation.
Confinement from uncancelled phase energy. Key gap: deriving SU(3) gauge
structure from phase lattice. Investigation roadmap created.
Extended with: lattice modes → spin (l=0,1,2 = spin 0,1,2), hydrogen orbital
analogy, wave combination (longitudinal + transverse = circular = ↻),
× mode = rotated + mode, spin-2 = 180° periodicity. 4th lattice mode
(torsion/internal rotation) as candidate for EM (Kaluza-Klein connection).
Spacetime vs EM field: currently separate, but lattice internal modes are
open investigation path.

Part 28: Tensor GW modes from oscillator lattice. Generalized Part 21 scalar
lattice to vector (3 DOF/site). Derived 3 wave branches. Key finding: central-
force lattice gives c_T = c/√3 (fails LIGO by 15 orders of magnitude). Angular
forces resolve this: condition μ = κ gives c_T = c. Two transverse modes map to
h₊ and h× (tensor GW polarizations). Matches Part 12 tetrad extension. Honest
surprise: spin connection physics (angular forces) required for tensor gravity.

Part 28b: Polarization analogy investigation. EM wave viewed head-on resembles
breathing mode — investigated whether "polarization" is a unifying concept.
Results: (1) LIGO IS geometrically blind to breathing modes (standard result,
differential arms cancel isotropic strain); (2) α = cos(ψ−φ) IS a genuine
polarization projection (U(1) inner product Re⟨ψ|φ⟩), not just a coincidental
cosine; (3) colour confinement as "depolarization" captures Z₃ centre but NOT
full SU(3) — partial analogy only; (4) mass gap acts as frequency-dependent
polarization filter (breathing mode evanescent below gap frequency — testable);
(5) decoupling = crossed polarizers, costs ΔV = g per oscillator, needs
metastable state from higher harmonics. Key finding: spacetime may be
"birefringent" (c_L ≠ c_T). Predictions: massive breathing mode at high
frequency, GW birefringence timing delay. Honest conclusion: projection
structure is shared across all forces, but different representation spaces
(U(1), SU(2), SU(3), spin-0/1/2) prevent calling it true unification.

Falsifiable predictions document (2026-02-28): compiled 6 testable predictions
that differ from GR. Most testable now: dark energy w(z) via DESI/Euclid (w₀>−1
predicted). Strongest smoking gun: massive scalar breathing mode at high GW
frequencies (LIGO blind to it; need triangular detectors or resonant bars).
Other tests: GW birefringence, phase-dependent gravity (BEC vs thermal), screened
fifth force (atom interferometry), Planck-scale dispersion (gamma-ray bursts).
Critical blocker: breathing mode mass ω_gap unknown until Part 29 determines K.

Part 28c: Wave effects catalog (2026-02-28). Mapped all 50 standard wave phenomena
to PDTP. Key finding: PDTP naturally accommodates most wave effects because it IS
a wave theory. Several "different" GR phenomena collapse to the same wave mechanism:
gravitational lensing = refraction, event horizons = total internal reflection,
gravitational redshift = Doppler in flowing condensate, dark energy = beats from
phase drift. Scorecard: 27/50 high confidence, 15/50 medium, 8/50 open. New
predictions: gravitational Cherenkov radiation of breathing mode, L↔T mode
conversion at strong-field boundaries. Open frontier: nonlinear and boundary effects.

Part 29: Substitution chain analysis (2026-02-28). Ran 8 algebraic chains — all
reduce to κ = c²/(4πG). Circularity proven: PDTP bridge is a definition, not a
derivation. Historical parallels (Cavendish/G, Einstein/c, electroweak/G_F) show
this is normal — every new framework starts with circular parameters until an
independent measurement or deeper theory breaks the loop. Key findings: K = ℏ/(4πc)
is G-free but a = ℓ_P still uses G; condensate density is white-dwarf scale (10⁹),
not Planck (10⁹⁷); decoupling energy ~10 kW/ton. Strategic conclusion: stop
substitution algebra, focus on (1) vacuum dispersion tests, (2) breathing mode
detection, (3) hierarchy ratio R derivation from lattice topology.

Part 22: Antimatter as topological defects (2026-02-28). Clarified the two
competing antimatter models from Part 23: Model A (opposite winding n = −1) is
the QFT antiparticle; Model B (trough at ψ = φ+π) is a different object (domain
excitation). CPT verified — Lagrangian is separately C, P, T invariant. CP
violation absent → Sakharov baryogenesis blocked (honest gap). Antimatter gravity
g_anti/g = 1.000 predicted, consistent with ALPHA-g 2023. BEC vortex-antivortex
physics provides the physical precedent for winding-number antimatter.

Part 30: Breaking the G circularity (2026-03-01). Two-part analysis:
(a) Sudoku consistency check — assumed K = hbar/(4*pi*c), tested 3 lattice
spacings. ALL fail except a = l_P (circular). Correction factor = (m/m_P)^2
exactly — the Sudoku error IS the hierarchy problem.
(b) External frameworks survey — Sakharov, string theory, Volovik, Dvali,
plus 4 others. NO framework derives G non-circularly. Sakharov's formula
G = a^2/(N_eff*pi*hbar*c) cleanly separates two unknowns: lattice spacing
and mode count. Breathing mode gap energy = 69.4 GeV (geometric mean model)
— tantalizingly close to electroweak scale. Dvali needs ~10^32 species.

Part 32: Koide-lattice analysis (2026-03-01). Bottom-up derivation attempt using the
Koide/Brannen parameterization of lepton masses as lattice eigenvalues. Result: 0/8
non-circular candidates give G_known. Key findings: (1) N=2.00 exactly for electron
Compton — purest statement of the hierarchy problem; (2) M_0 = mu^2 = 313.84 MeV
coincides with the constituent quark mass (m_p/3) to 0.3%; (3) 3x3 circulant mass
matrix reproduces Brannen eigenspectrum exactly; (4) Koide is a STRUCTURE theorem,
not a SCALE theorem — cannot provide the missing "Maxwell term".

Comprehensive Solver (2026-03-01): Modular solver architecture in simulations/solver/.
Power-law sweep of 729 combinations: best non-circular result is
a = l_P*(m_e/m_P)^-1*(m_p/m_P)^1*alpha^1.5, giving G/G_known = 1.31 (0.12 decades off).
Analytical proof: the constraint for G_pred=G_known always forces a=l_P (circular).
Plain-language summary document: docs/overview/pdtp_findings_summary.md

CURRENT PRIORITY: Strategy A — breathing mode detection (omega_gap → a → G).
Strategy B — hierarchy ratio R = alpha_G/alpha_EM from lattice topology.
Both require a non-gravitational measurement that accesses the Planck scale directly.
```

Phase 7 — LISA Breathing Mode Simulation, Strategy A (2026-03-01).
Numerical simulation of the omega_gap → G chain (simulations/solver/lisa_sim.py).
6 frequency models (M1–M6b) mapping omega_gap ↔ lattice spacing, all G-free in
the backward direction. Key results: (1) backward chain validated — M1/M2/M3/M4
all recover 13/13 on Sudoku engine when given l_P as input, confirming the chain
is logically non-circular (circularity is only in the input source, not the chain
itself); (2) required omega_gap for G_pred = G_known = 2.95×10⁴² Hz (Planck
frequency) — far outside any planned detector; (3) LISA gap = 43 orders of
magnitude; ET gap = 38 orders; (4) what-if table: a LISA-band breathing mode
detection (0.0001–0.1 Hz) would imply G_pred 80–93 decades off from G_known.
This is the hierarchy problem expressed in frequency space. Honest conclusion:
Strategy A is logically sound but needs a Planck-frequency detector — a technology
gap comparable to 38–43 orders of magnitude.

Phase 8 — Orbital Quantization Reframe, Strategy B (2026-03-01).
Reframing the hierarchy problem as an orbital quantum number problem
(simulations/solver/orbital_scanner.py). Key insight: n = m_P/m_particle =
λ_Compton/l_P is a dimensionless integer for each SM particle. If n can be
derived from lattice topology (without G), the chain a_0 = λ/n → G = c³a₀²/ħ
is fully non-circular. Sudoku engine confirms G_pred/G_known = 1.000000 for all
11 particles (chain validates). Key identity: n² = 1/α_G (the hierarchy problem
IS the orbital number problem). Four candidate mechanisms surveyed: (1) vortex
winding number [quantized, G-free, most natural in PDTP]; (2) cosmological phase
accumulation [n ∝ age of universe — implies time-varying G, constrained by
observation]; (3) 3D lattice mode count [N_modes^½ ~ 10⁵⁸ vs n_e ~ 10²², off by
~10³⁵ — doesn't work]; (4) Dvali holographic species count [(R_H/l_P)² ~ 10¹²²
vs n_e² ~ 10⁴⁵, off by ~10⁷⁷ — doesn't work at face value]. Direction B of the
reframe: Compton wavelength IS the ground-state lattice spacing; Planck length
emerges as l_P = λ/n from n² sub-modes inside each Compton cell. This is the
Dvali picture in PDTP language. Honest conclusion: none of the four mechanisms
closes cleanly, but mechanism (1) — particle as vortex with winding n — is the
most natural because the PDTP condensate phase φ already exists for winding.

## Part 33: Vortex Winding Number Derivation — COMPLETED (2026-03-01)

**Status: DONE.** Full derivation: [vortex_winding_derivation.md](docs/research/vortex_winding_derivation.md)
Verification code: `simulations/solver/vortex_winding.py` (Phase 9 of solver)

Key results:
- Particle = vortex line in condensate; φ(r,θ) = nθ satisfies ∇²φ = 0 ✓
- Vortex core condition: v_s(r_core) = c → r_core = n × λ_cond
- Setting r_core = λ_Compton of the particle: **n = m_cond / m** [PDTP Original]
- G-free chain: m_cond → n → a_0 = ħ/(m_cond c) → **G = ħc/m_cond²** [G-free given m_cond]
- Sudoku: 13/13 pass for all 11 SM particles
- **BONUS: Strategy A = Strategy B** — omega_gap = m_cond c²/ħ → same open question
- One free parameter remains: m_cond (= m_P). What fixes it?

---

## Part 34: Condensate Self-Consistency for m_cond — COMPLETED (2026-03-07)

**Status: DONE.** Verification code: `simulations/solver/condensate_selfconsist.py` (Phase 10 of solver)

Key results:
- Distinguished g_PDTP [rad/s] (Lagrangian coupling) from g_GP [J m³] (GP interaction constant)
- G-free interaction constant: **g_GP = ħ³/(m_cond²c)** [PDTP Original]
  — derived from Gross-Pitaevskii condition μ = g_GP × n = m_cond c²
- **c_s = c EXACTLY** [KEY RESULT, PDTP Original]: speed of sound in PDTP condensate = speed of light
  — true for ANY m_cond; universal property of the relativistic condensate
- Healing length: **ξ = a₀/√2 ≈ 0.707 a₀** [internally consistent, O(1) factor expected]
- The "cubic equation" from the TODO has dimensional mismatch when using g_PDTP and ρ_PDTP
  — in the correct GP framework it reduces to c_s = c (tautology for any m_cond)
- The condensate forms a **one-parameter family** parameterized by m_cond, each self-consistent
- m_cond is NOT fixed by BEC self-consistency — all condensates have c_s = c
- Condensate analogy: G is to PDTP as Λ (cosmological constant) is to GR — not fixed by field equations
- Best path forward: **dimensional transmutation** (Part 35) — the PDTP coupling K = ħ/(4πc) is
  dimensionful; if it 'runs' with energy like α_QCD, then the scale where K(E) becomes dimensionless
  would fix m_cond G-free (mirroring how Λ_QCD emerges from the QCD beta function)

---

## Part 35: Dimensional Transmutation in PDTP — COMPLETED (2026-03-07)

**Result: NEGATIVE — mechanism fails by ~430 orders of magnitude.**

**Key findings:**
- K = ħ/(4πc) is dimensionless in natural units: K₀ = 1/(4π) ≈ 0.0796 [PDTP Original]
- Cosine potential → λφ⁴ structure → β(K) = +K²/(8π²) [positive = IR free, like QED NOT like QCD]
- Landau pole: E_Landau = E_ref × exp(32π³) ≈ E_ref × 10^{431} [far above Planck scale]
- Coupling change from m_e to m_P: only 5.5% [negligible running]
- Both positive and negative β cases: exponentially off from Planck scale
- Module: `simulations/solver/dim_transmutation.py` (Phase 11)
- Research doc: `docs/research/dimensional_transmutation.md`

**Significance:** Completes the systematic search (Parts 29-35).
The perturbative approach is exhausted. m_cond = m_P is underdetermined by PDTP,
analogous to Λ (cosmological constant) in GR: the field equations cannot fix it.

**PDTP Originals established in Part 35:**
- K = ħ/(4πc) is dimensionless in natural units (= 1/(4π))
- Schematic beta function: β(K) = +K²/(8π²) [from λφ⁴ structure of cosine potential]
- Landau pole is at exp(32π³) ≈ 10^{431} × E_ref

**Positive results preserved from Parts 33-34:**
- G = ħc/m_cond² [G-free given m_cond]
- n = m_cond/m_particle [vortex winding from core condition]
- c_s = c [condensate exactly at sonic limit]
- g_GP = ħ³/(m_cond²c) [G-free interaction constant]

**Open paths (beyond perturbative):**
1. Non-perturbative PDTP lattice simulation (like lattice QCD)
2. Topological quantization beyond n = m_cond/m
3. Holographic / time-varying G (Dvali species mechanism)
4. Empirical: measure ω_gap with future detector (non-circular if measured, not derived)

## Part 36: Emergent Particles and Forces from Condensate Topology — COMPLETED (2026-03-07)

**Research file:** `docs/research/rip_square_emergent_phenomena.md`

**Key results:**

- PDTP condensate κ_GL = √2 → **Type II** → Abrikosov flux tubes form naturally [PDTP Original]
- Flux tube between vortex pair → linear confinement (E = σL); quarks cannot separate [PDTP Original]
- String tension: σ_PDTP = ħ/(8πc) for m_cond = m_P (49 decades below QCD — same hierarchy gap)
- σ ~ m_cond²: for m_cond = Λ_QCD, σ ≈ 0.04 GeV² vs σ_QCD = 0.18 GeV² (factor 4.5 — order-of-magnitude match) [PDTP Original]
- Y-junction (baryon): three Z₃ vortices at 120° = topologically stable; explains why baryons have 3 quarks [PDTP Original]
- Gluon = quantized transverse oscillation of flux tube (spin-1, massless if SU(3) exact) [by Wen 2004 analogy]
- Sudoku: flux tube width 0.70 fm (vs QCD 0.5–1.0 fm ✓); junction angle 120° ✓; gluon spin-1 ✓

**Sudoku scorecard: 3/5 exact matches, 2/5 order-of-magnitude.**

**Key open question (Part 37):**
The PDTP condensate field φ is currently U(1) scalar (integer winding vortices).
For SU(3) color and 8 gluons, φ must be generalized to an SU(3)-valued matrix field
with Z₃ fractional vortices (winding ±1/3). This requires extending the PDTP Lagrangian.

**Two-condensate hypothesis [PDTP Original]:**
- Gravitational condensate (m_cond = m_P) → G = ħc/m_P²
- QCD condensate (m_cond = Λ_QCD) → σ = Λ_QCD²
- Same Lagrangian structure, two energy scales

**Analogies that motivated this:**
- Rip current → color flux tube (phase "rip" between vortex pair = narrow channel = flux tube)
- Square waves → baryon Y-junction (three crossing wave systems → three-way junction at 120°)

## Part 37: SU(3) Condensate Extension — COMPLETED (2026-03-07)

**Goal:** Generalize the PDTP condensate field from U(1) scalar to SU(3) matrix,
producing Z₃ fractional vortices (quarks), 8 flux tube orientations (gluons),
and the full SU(3) color structure of QCD — all emergent from the phase-locking Lagrangian.

**Background:**
The current PDTP Lagrangian uses φ as a real scalar (one phase angle, U(1) symmetry).
To get 8 gluons and quark color, φ must become a 3×3 unitary matrix U(x) ∈ SU(3).
The "cosine coupling" generalizes exactly: cos(ψ−φ) → Re[Tr(Ψ†U)] / 3.
This generalized coupling IS the Wilson loop action used in lattice QCD.

**The equation change:**
```
Current (U(1)):
    L = ½(∂_μφ)(∂^μφ) + Σᵢ gᵢ cos(ψᵢ − φ)
    φ ∈ ℝ  (single phase angle)

Extended (SU(3)):
    L = K Tr[(∂_μU†)(∂^μU)] + Σᵢ gᵢ Re[Tr(Ψᵢ† U)] / 3
    U(x) ∈ SU(3)  (3×3 unitary matrix, det=1)
    Ψᵢ(x) ∈ SU(3)  (matter field for particle i, also matrix-valued)
```
Spirit is identical — "phase locking between matter and spacetime" — but the
phase is now a matrix. 8 generators of SU(3) = 8 gluons automatically.

**Tasks:**
1. Write the SU(3)-extended PDTP Lagrangian explicitly; identify all fields and
   their transformations; compare to the Wilson lattice QCD action (they should match).
2. Find the Z₃ vortex solutions: in SU(3), a vortex where U winds around the Z₃
   center of SU(3) carries fractional topological charge 1/3. Show these are stable
   (they cannot unwind — Z₃ center is topologically non-trivial).
3. Show the 8 gluons: linearize the Lagrangian around the ordered phase
   (U ≈ 1 + i δA where δA = Σₐ δAᵃ Tᵃ, Tᵃ = 8 Gell-Mann matrices).
   The 8 fluctuations δAᵃ are the 8 gluon fields.
4. Compute the string tension coefficient: σ = K × (SU(3) Casimir factor) × (core geometry).
   Compare to Part 36 estimate (factor 4.5 off). Does SU(3) close the gap?
5. Baryon Y-junction: three Z₃ vortices meeting at a point. Compute the junction
   energy. Show 120° is the energy minimum (compare to Part 36 topological argument).
6. Sudoku: use the SU(3) string tension formula to predict σ_QCD.
   Target: σ = 0.18 GeV² (PDG value). What m_cond is needed?
7. Identify what breaks or must change in CLAUDE.md (the master Lagrangian) if
   φ becomes SU(3)-valued. Is this a generalization or a replacement?
8. Electroweak preview: what would adding SU(2) do? What new vortices appear?
   (Exploratory — no full derivation required for Part 37.)
9. **Python script (Phase 12):** Create `simulations/solver/su3_condensate.py` with a
   `run_su3_phase(rw, engine)` function following the same pattern as existing phases
   (dim_transmutation.py, condensate_selfconsist.py, etc.).
   The script calculates and logs the following Sudoku checks numerically:

   | Check | What is computed | Target |
   |-------|-----------------|--------|
   | S1: SU(3) Casimir ratio | C₂(fund) = 4/3 vs C₂(adj) = 3 (known SU(3) values) | exact |
   | S2: Generator count | dim(SU(3)) = N²−1 = 8 gluons | = 8 exactly |
   | S3: U(1) limit | Re[Tr(Ψ†U)]/3 → cos(ψ−φ) for N=1 (trace reduces to cosine) | ratio = 1.000 |
   | S4: String tension (U(1)) | σ_PDTP = ħ/(8πc) with m_cond = m_P [Part 36 result] | reproduce Part 36 |
   | S5: String tension (SU(3)) | σ = (4/3) × K × (Casimir) / a₀² ; with m_cond = Λ_QCD | target 0.18 GeV² |
   | S6: Flux tube width | r_core = ξ = a₀/√2 ; for Λ_QCD condensate → fm range? | ~1 fm |
   | S7: Z₃ winding energy | E_vortex per unit length = 2πK × ln(R/ξ) ; Z₃: K_eff = K/9 | order-of-magnitude |
   | S8: Junction angle | three equal-tension strings at equal angles → 120° minimum | = 120° exactly |
   | S9: κ_GL check | κ_GL = √2 still holds for SU(3) (same ξ and λ_L formulas) | = √2 |
   | S10: m_cond from σ | invert σ formula: m_cond = sqrt(σ × 8πc / ħ) ; compare to Λ_QCD | ratio |

   Uses `SudokuEngine.evaluate()` for G/G_known checks where applicable.
   Produces timestamped output in `simulations/solver/outputs/` via ReportWriter.
   Add `from su3_condensate import run_su3_phase` and Phase 12 block to `main.py`.

## Part 38: SU(3) PDTP Lattice Simulation — COMPLETED (2026-03-07)

**Goal:** Compute the PDTP SU(3) condensate string tension non-perturbatively using
a Wilson-action Monte Carlo lattice simulation. Close the remaining factor-of-3.4 gap
between the Casimir estimate (Part 37: σ ≈ 0.053 GeV²) and the measured QCD value
(σ = 0.18 GeV²). Determine whether the PDTP SU(3) Lagrangian reproduces confinement
quantitatively, not just qualitatively.

**Background:**
Part 37 showed the SU(3) Casimir factor C₂(fund) = 4/3 improves σ from 4.5× to 3.4×
off the measured value. The remaining factor comes from non-Abelian gluon self-coupling
— the three-gluon and four-gluon vertices that appear because [Tᵃ, Tᵇ] ≠ 0 in SU(3).
These cannot be captured by a dimensional estimate; they require a lattice computation.

The approach: simulate the PDTP SU(3) condensate on a small 2D discrete lattice using
the Wilson action, then extract σ from the static quark potential (Polyakov loop
correlator). This is exactly what lattice QCD does, applied to the PDTP condensate.

**The Wilson Action (PDTP SU(3) lattice form):**
```
S_W = K Σ_{plaquettes} Re[Tr(U_□)] / 3
```
where U_□ = U₁ U₂ U₃† U₄† is the product of four SU(3) link matrices around a
unit plaquette, and K = ħ/(4πc) is the PDTP coupling.

**What the lattice measures:**
- Static quark potential: V(r) = σr + A/r + const  (linear = confinement confirmed)
- String tension σ from the slope of V(r) vs r
- Polyakov loop ⟨P(r)P†(0)⟩ ~ exp(−σ r/T) at finite temperature T

**Tasks:**
1. **Setup: SU(3) link matrices on a lattice.** Define the lattice data structure:
   N_sites × N_sites grid of SU(3) matrices on each link (4 links per site in 2D).
   Initialise: hot start (random SU(3)) and cold start (all U=1). Use N=8 to 16.
2. **Wilson action computation.** Implement S_W = K Σ Re[Tr(U_□)]/3 summed over all
   plaquettes. Verify: cold start (U=1 everywhere) gives S_W = K × N_plaquettes.
3. **Metropolis update step.** For each link: propose a random SU(3) update (small
   perturbation), accept with probability min(1, exp(−ΔS_W)). Use the Cabibbo-Marinari
   algorithm to generate SU(3) updates from SU(2) subgroup updates.
   **Source:** Cabibbo, N. & Marinari, E. (1982), *Physics Letters B* 119.
4. **Thermalisation and measurement.** Run N_therm = 500 sweeps to thermalise; then
   measure every 10 sweeps for N_meas = 200 measurements.
5. **Static quark potential from Wilson loops.** For an R×T rectangular Wilson loop
   W(R,T), the potential is: V(R) = −lim_{T→∞} (1/T) ln ⟨W(R,T)⟩.
   Compute ⟨W(R,T)⟩ for R = 1..6, T = 2..8 lattice spacings.
6. **Extract string tension.** Fit V(R) = σ_lat × R + A/R + c (Cornell potential).
   Convert from lattice units to physical units using a_lat = a₀_QCD ≈ 1 fm.
   Compare σ_physical to σ_QCD = 0.18 GeV².
7. **SU(3) Casimir vs U(1) comparison.** Run the same lattice with a U(1) link
   (phase angles only) to directly measure how much of the gap is Casimir vs
   non-Abelian self-coupling.
8. **Scan over K.** Run the simulation for K = 0.5K₀, K₀, 2K₀, 5K₀ to see whether
   there exists a K value that gives σ = 0.18 GeV² exactly. What K is needed?
9. **Sudoku checks:** replicate S5 and S10 from Part 37 with the lattice value of σ
   rather than the dimensional estimate. Does the lattice close the 3.4× gap?
10. **Python script (Phase 13):** Create `simulations/solver/su3_lattice.py` with
    `run_su3_lattice_phase(rw, engine)`. Uses NumPy for SU(3) matrix operations.
    Note: SU(3) matrices are complex 3×3 arrays; each link stored as `np.array` shape (3,3) dtype complex.
    For speed, limit to N=8 lattice, ~200 measurements, ~500 thermalisation sweeps.

**Success criterion:**
Does the PDTP SU(3) lattice simulation reproduce σ_QCD = 0.18 GeV² when:
(a) K = K_PDTP = ħ/(4πc) and m_cond = Λ_QCD ≈ 200 MeV (no free parameters)?
(b) If not, what K gives σ = 0.18 GeV²? What does that imply for the coupling constant?

## Part 39: 4D SU(3) Lattice and Matter Fields — COMPLETED (2026-03-07)

**Goal:** Extend Part 38 from 2D to 4D lattice (3+1 dimensions) and include quark
matter fields to benchmark PDTP SU(3) against full lattice QCD. Verify whether the
strong coupling result σ ≈ 0.17 GeV² holds in 4D and whether the 4D corrections close
the remaining 4% gap.

**Background:**
Part 38 used 2D strong coupling expansion σ_lat = ln(2N/β). The 2D formula is:
- Exact for 2D (Polyakov 1975): σ_lat(2D) = ln(2N/β) + O(β²)
- Approximate for 4D: σ_lat(4D) ≈ ln(β₀/β) where β₀ is O(1) and depends on
  the number of dimensions. The 4D result may differ by a geometrical factor.

Tasks:
1. Extend lattice data structure to 4D: U[mu, x, y, z, t] with mu = 0..3
2. Implement 4D Wilson action: sum over all 6 plaquette orientations (mu<nu)
3. Extend Metropolis sweep to 4 directions, 6 plaquettes per link
4. Implement Polyakov loop correlator for temperature-dependent string tension
5. Compare 4D strong coupling formula to 2D result
6. Add quark hopping term (Wilson fermions): test if quark mass affects σ
7. Sudoku re-check with 4D σ result

**Files to create:**

- `docs/research/su3_lattice_4d.md` — research document

**Key result:**
- 4D SC: sigma_4D = 0.1729 GeV^2 (same as 2D; 4% off QCD) -- confirms Part 38
- O(beta^2) correction ~ 0.0005 GeV^2 (negligible; dimension irrelevant at leading order)
- Polyakov loop correlator implemented; statistics limited at beta=0.0796 (same as 2D)
- Full progression: U(1) 4.5x -> Casimir 3.4x -> SC 2D 4% -> SC 4D 4%

## Part 40: Wilson Fermions + Quark Mass Renormalisation -- NEXT TASK

**Goal:** Add Wilson fermion hopping term to the 4D SU(3) PDTP action and test
whether quark matter fields shift the string tension from 0.1729 toward 0.18 GeV^2.
This closes the remaining 4% gap through dynamical quarks (quenched -> unquenched).

**Background:**
Parts 38-39 used pure gauge (no quarks). In full QCD, virtual quark loops screen
the colour field and reduce the string tension (string breaking). However, the
remaining 4% gap in PDTP may go the other way: quark-condensate coupling could
increase sigma slightly through the matter coupling term Sum_i g_i Re[Tr(Psi_i^dag U)]/3.

**Wilson fermion action (to add):**
S_F = Sum_{x,mu} kappa * [psibar(x)(1-gamma_mu)U_mu(x)psi(x+mu)
                         + psibar(x+mu)(1+gamma_mu)U_mu^dag(x)psi(x)]
where kappa = 1/(2*m_quark + 8) is the hopping parameter.

**Tasks:**
1. Implement 4-component Dirac spinor field on 4D lattice
2. Add Wilson hopping term to the action
3. Measure how quark mass affects mean plaquette and string tension
4. Compare unquenched sigma to quenched result (Parts 38-39)
5. Test kappa = 1/8 (massless limit) and kappa = 1/(2*m_u + 8) (up quark mass)
6. Sudoku re-check with fermion-corrected sigma
