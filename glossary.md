# Glossary

This glossary defines specialized terms used throughout the
Phase-Decoupled Physics repository.

---

## Matter-Wave

A standing wave pattern representing matter at the most fundamental level.
Particles are interpreted as stable wave formations rather than point objects.

---

## Spacetime-Wave

The wave-supporting structure of spacetime itself.
Spacetime is treated as a dynamic oscillatory medium capable of curvature,
ripple, and phase gradients.

---

## Phase

The position within a wave’s oscillation cycle.

Phase alignment between systems determines how strongly they interact.

---

## Phase-Locking

A condition where two oscillatory systems synchronize their phases
into a stable relationship.

In this framework:

Gravity = Phase-locking between matter-waves and spacetime-waves.

---

## Phase Gradient

A change in phase across space.

Equivalent to a slope in wave geometry.

Objects follow phase gradients naturally.

---

## Phase-Decoupling

Reduction of phase-lock strength between matter-waves and spacetime-waves.

Results in:

- Reduced gravity
- Reduced inertia

---

## Coherence

A condition where many waves maintain stable phase relationships.

High coherence means:

- Unified wave behavior
- Predictable phase control

---

## Macroscopic Coherence

Coherence maintained across visible or structural scales rather than atomic scales.

Required for PDTP operation.

---

## Coherence Core

The central system in a PDTP that maintains macroscopic quantum coherence.

Acts as the phase reference origin.

---

## Coupling Strength

Degree of phase-lock between matter-waves and spacetime-waves.

High coupling:
- Normal gravity
- Normal inertia

Low coupling:
- Reduced gravity
- Reduced inertia

---

## Coupling Suppression Envelope

Region surrounding a PDTP where coupling strength is intentionally reduced.

Enables hover and inertial decoupling.

---

## Phase Control Layer

Subsystem responsible for adjusting internal phase alignment and coherence.

---

## Spacetime Phase Sensors

Sensors that detect local spacetime phase gradients (gravity geometry).

Provide feedback for stabilization.

---

## Phase Actuator

Device that locally modifies phase gradients.

Used for movement and orientation.

---

## Inertial Decoupling

Reduction of resistance to acceleration due to weakened spacetime coupling.

Allows extreme acceleration without internal forces.

---

## Standing Wave

A wave pattern that remains spatially fixed while oscillating.

Basis of matter in this model.

---

## Motion Framework

Renamed term for spacetime.

Defines allowable motion paths.

---

## Particle Generator

Renamed term for quantum fields.

Continuous fields that generate particle excitations.

---

## Mass Environment

Renamed term for Higgs field.

Determines how particles acquire mass.

---

## Mass Attraction

Renamed term for gravity.

Spacetime phase-locking interaction.

---

## Charge Carrier

Renamed term for electron.

---

## Binding Messenger

Renamed term for gluon.

---

## Light Messenger

Renamed term for photon.

---

## Ghost Particle

Renamed term for neutrino.

---

## Phase Gradient Steering

Movement method where an object follows a tilted phase slope rather than being pushed.

---

## Reactionless Motion

Movement that does not rely on expelling mass.

PDTP motion is reactionless.

---

## Field Containment Shell

Structural layer that confines coherent fields around a PDTP.

---

## Decoherence

Loss of phase coherence.

Major failure mode for PDTP systems.

---

## Lock Bandwidth

Range of phase mismatch over which phase-lock remains stable.

Narrow bandwidth = precise but fragile.

Wide bandwidth = stable but less controllable.

---

## Phase Reference

Stable oscillator defining internal phase rhythm.

---

## Toroidal Field

Donut-shaped field geometry.

Common in disc craft layouts.

---

## Gradient Flattening

Process of reducing phase slope to zero.

Produces hover or stationary state.

---

## Phase Tilt

Small angular change in gradient direction.

Produces movement.

---

## Standing-Wave Matter Model

Concept that all matter is composed of standing waves.

---

## Spacetime Engineering

Broad term for deliberate manipulation of spacetime geometry and phase.

---

## Reaction Mass

Material expelled to generate thrust in classical propulsion.

Not used by PDTP.
