# PDTP Framework Summary

## What Is Gravity?

**Gravity is phase-locking.**

Everything vibrates. Matter is a standing wave with a phase ψ. Spacetime itself has a phase field φ. These two phases want to synchronize — exactly like pendulum clocks on the same wall, or fireflies blinking in unison.

The coupling energy is:

```
V = −g cos(ψ − φ)
```

When ψ = φ (phases aligned), energy is minimized. The system naturally falls into this state. That falling-into-alignment **is** gravity.

An apple doesn't get pulled down. Its internal wave phase synchronizes with spacetime's phase gradient and follows the slope. Falling is phase-following.

## The Coupling Parameter

The strength of the phase-lock is α = cos(ψ − φ):

| α Value | Coupling State | Result |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| α = 1 | Fully locked | Normal gravity, normal inertia |
| 0 < α < 1 | Partially locked | Reduced gravity, reduced inertia |
| α = 0 | Decoupled | No gravity, no inertia (theoretical limit) |

## The Core Equation

The full Lagrangian:

```
L = ½(∂μφ)(∂^μφ) + Σᵢ ½(∂μψᵢ)(∂^μψᵢ) + Σᵢ gᵢ cos(ψᵢ − φ)
```

From this single expression, everything follows — the field equations, conservation laws, stability, Newtonian gravity recovery, and testable predictions.

## One Sentence

Gravity is not a force pulling objects together — it is the tendency of matter-waves and spacetime-waves to synchronize their phases.
