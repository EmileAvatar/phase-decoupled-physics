directions. The pattern has fixed nodes (zero displacement) and antinodes
(maximum displacement) that do not move.

Wave speed depends on frequency. Different frequency components of a wave

electromagnetic field is zero — only the vector potential matters. This
proves that the phase (not just the field) is physically real.

**Source:** [Aharonov-Bohm effect — Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aharonov%E2%80%93Bohm_effect)

### 41. Quantum tunneling

A particle's wavefunction extends through a potential barrier, giving a
nonzero probability of appearing on the other side — even when it
classically lacks the energy to cross.

**Source:** [Quantum tunneling — Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tunnelling)

### 42. De Broglie wavelength

Every particle has an associated wavelength: lambda = h / p, where h is
Planck's constant and p is momentum. Heavier or faster particles have

## 1.9 Mechanical and Medium Effects

**Source:** [Scattering — Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering)

### 46. Impedance matching

When the impedance of the source, medium, and receiver are matched,
energy transfers maximally with no reflection. Mismatched impedance
causes partial reflection at boundaries.

**Source:** [Impedance matching — Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impedance_matching)

### 47. Mode conversion

wave hitting a surface can partially convert to a transverse wave.

# Section 2: PDTP Connections

How does each wave phenomenon connect to PDTP's framework of phase-locked
oscillators? Below, each effect is mapped to the specific PDTP mechanism
it corresponds to, with an honest assessment of what works, what is
speculative, and what remains open.

**Key PDTP elements used in this mapping:**

```
Spacetime condensate field:    phi (scalar phase)
Matter wave field:             psi_i (particle phases)
Coupling:                      alpha = cos(psi - phi)
Lattice Hamiltonian:           H = Sum (I/2)(d_t theta_i)^2
                                 + (K/2) Sum_<i,j> (theta_i - theta_j)^2
Speed of light:                c^2 = kappa / rho
Newton's constant:             G = c^2 / (4 pi kappa)
Dispersion (massive mode):     omega^2 = c^2 k^2 + omega_gap^2
Dispersion (massless modes):   omega = c |k|
```

---

## 2.1 Fundamental Wave Types in PDTP

### Effect 1: Longitudinal waves — THE BREATHING MODE

**PDTP connection:** Direct and fundamental.

The Part 21 scalar lattice (1 DOF per site — phase angle theta_i) supports
exactly one wave type: longitudinal compression waves, where the phase
oscillates along the propagation direction. This **is** the scalar
breathing mode.

```
Longitudinal branch:   omega^2 = c^2 k^2 + omega_gap^2     (massive)
```

The mass gap omega_gap comes from the cos(psi - phi) coupling — the same
coupling that creates gravity. This is why the breathing mode is massive:
phase-locking costs energy to excite.

**PDTP Original:** The breathing mode is the longitudinal phonon of the
spacetime condensate, with mass set by the gravitational coupling strength.

**Cross-ref:** Part 28 §5, Part 21 §4.

**Confidence:** High — this is the most natural prediction of the scalar
lattice.

---

### Effect 2: Transverse waves — TENSOR GRAVITATIONAL WAVES

**PDTP connection:** Direct — requires vector generalization of the lattice.

When the lattice is generalized from scalar (1 DOF) to vector (3 DOF per
site), it supports shear deformations — displacements perpendicular to
the propagation direction. These are transverse waves with two independent
polarizations.

```
Transverse branches:   omega = c |k|                        (massless, x2)
```

These two transverse modes map directly to the h_+ and h_x tensor
polarizations that LIGO detects. They are massless because the cos coupling
only affects the longitudinal sector.

**PDTP Original:** Tensor GW modes emerge as transverse phonons of the
spacetime lattice, but require angular (non-central) forces with the
specific condition mu_shear = kappa for c_T = c.

**Cross-ref:** Part 28 §4-5.

**Confidence:** Medium — the mechanism works, but requires angular forces
beyond the simple central-force model. The condition mu = kappa is
specific and falsifiable.

**Honest caveat:** Central forces alone give c_T = c/sqrt(3), which is
ruled out by LIGO. Angular forces (spin-connection physics) are needed
to get c_T = c.

---

### Effect 3: Surface waves — DOMAIN BOUNDARIES

**PDTP connection:** Speculative but physically motivated.

In PDTP, if the condensate has domains (regions of different phase phi),
the boundary between domains would be a 2D surface where the phase
changes rapidly. Waves confined to that surface would combine longitudinal
and transverse motion — exactly like surface waves.

**PDTP Original:** Domain walls in the condensate phase field could
support surface-wave-like excitations. These would be topological defects.

**Source:** [Topological defect — Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_defect)

**Cross-ref:** Part 21 §6 (vortex solutions).

**Confidence:** Low — not yet derived. This is an open problem.

---

### Effect 4: Standing waves — BOUND STATES (PARTICLES)

**PDTP connection:** Fundamental and profound.

A standing wave is a wave that doesn't travel — it stays in place. In
PDTP, **particles are standing waves in the condensate**. A hydrogen atom
is a standing wave pattern in the matter-wave field psi, phase-locked to
the spacetime field phi.

```
Standing wave condition:     k_n = n pi / L     (quantized)
```

The quantized energy levels of atoms are literally the harmonics of these
standing waves. The particle's rest mass is the energy stored in the
phase distortion pattern.

**PDTP Original:** Rest mass = energy of a localized standing-wave
distortion in the phase field. M = integral of phase gradient energy.

**Cross-ref:** Part 21 §5 (mass from phase distortion).

**Confidence:** High — this is the core PDTP claim about what particles
are.

---

### Effect 5: Progressive (traveling) waves — FREE PROPAGATION

**PDTP connection:** Direct.

Free-propagating waves in the condensate are the normal mode of spacetime.
The speed of light c emerges as the phase velocity of these waves:

```
c^2 = kappa / rho     (lattice stiffness / inertia density)
```

A photon is a traveling wave in the EM sector; a gravitational wave is
a traveling wave in the metric sector — both propagate through the same
condensate at the same speed c (for massless modes).

**Cross-ref:** Part 21 §3 (speed of light derivation).

**Confidence:** High.

---

## 2.2 Core Wave Properties in PDTP

### Effects 6-13: Wavelength, Frequency, Amplitude, Period, Wave Speed, Phase, Angular Frequency, Wave Number

**PDTP connection:** All standard wave parameters apply directly, because
PDTP **is** a wave theory.

The crucial PDTP-specific point is about **phase** (Effect 11):

In standard physics, phase is a mathematical label. In PDTP, phase is
the fundamental physical variable. The coupling alpha = cos(psi - phi)
means that the **relative phase between matter and spacetime** determines
the strength of gravity. This makes phase physically observable via its
gravitational consequences.

```
alpha = cos(psi - phi)     phase difference → gravitational coupling
```

- Phase aligned (psi = phi):   alpha = 1, maximum gravity
- Phase orthogonal (psi - phi = pi/2):   alpha = 0, zero gravity
- Phase opposed (psi - phi = pi):   alpha = -1, repulsive (anti-gravity)

**PDTP Original:** Phase difference is the fundamental variable that
controls gravitational coupling strength.

**Cross-ref:** Part 1 §2 (Lagrangian), Part 28b §3 (U(1) projection).

**Confidence:** High — this is definitional in PDTP.

---

## 2.3 Reflection and Boundary Effects in PDTP

### Effect 14: Reflection — PHASE BOUNDARIES

**PDTP connection:** Direct analogy with established physics.

When a wave encounters a region where the condensate properties change
(different kappa or rho), part of the wave reflects. In PDTP, this
corresponds to a region of different spacetime stiffness — i.e., a
gravitational potential gradient.

The reflection coefficient depends on the impedance mismatch:

```
Z = sqrt(kappa * rho)     (condensate impedance)
R = |(Z_2 - Z_1) / (Z_2 + Z_1)|^2
```

**PDTP Original:** Gravitational reflection occurs at sharp changes in
condensate stiffness. This is related to the scattering of gravitational
waves off density inhomogeneities.

**Cross-ref:** Part 16 (fine structure — impedance ratio).

**Confidence:** Medium — the formalism exists, quantitative predictions
need work.

---

### Effect 15: Refraction — GRAVITATIONAL LENSING

**PDTP connection:** Direct and quantitative.

In PDTP, the speed of light depends on local condensate properties:
c^2 = kappa/rho. Near a massive object, the condensate is compressed
(higher effective rho), so waves slow down. Slower waves on one side of
the beam cause the wavefront to bend — this is gravitational lensing.

```
Effective refractive index:   n(r) = c_far / c_local = sqrt(rho_local / rho_far)
```

This is mathematically identical to how light bends in glass (higher n =
slower speed = more bending). PDTP says gravitational lensing IS
refraction — the same physical mechanism, not just an analogy.

**Source:** [Gravitational lens — Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lens)

**PDTP Original:** Gravitational lensing = refraction through a
condensate with position-dependent wave speed.

**Cross-ref:** Part 1 §9 (Schwarzschild metric recovery).

**Confidence:** High — reproduces the standard GR prediction for light
deflection.

---

### Effect 16: Total internal reflection — HORIZONS

**PDTP connection:** Striking and physically deep.

Total internal reflection occurs when a wave cannot enter a region of
lower refractive index above the critical angle. In PDTP, the
Schwarzschild radius is where the effective refractive index goes to
infinity — the "critical angle" becomes zero. **No wave can escape.**

```
At r = r_s:    n(r) → infinity    (c_local → 0)
```

The black hole event horizon IS total internal reflection. Waves inside
the horizon cannot find any angle at which they can transmit outward.

**Source:** [Total internal reflection — Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_internal_reflection)

**PDTP Original:** The event horizon is the PDTP analogue of total
internal reflection — the condensate wave speed drops to zero, trapping
all modes.

**Cross-ref:** Part 24 (Hawking radiation = acoustic horizon), Part 14
(strong-field EP).

**Confidence:** High — this maps exactly to the analogue gravity
framework (Unruh 1981).

---

### Effect 17: Diffraction — GRAVITATIONAL WAVE SCATTERING

**PDTP connection:** Direct but uncomputed.

Gravitational waves diffracting around massive objects is a standard GR
prediction. In PDTP, this is wave diffraction through a condensate with
varying properties. The effect becomes significant when the wavelength is
comparable to the object size — exactly as for any wave.

**Source:** [Gravitational wave — Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave)

**Confidence:** Medium — qualitatively clear, quantitative computation
not yet done in PDTP.

---

## 2.4 Interference and Superposition in PDTP

### Effects 18-19: Constructive/Destructive Interference — PHASE LOCKING/DECOUPLING

**PDTP connection:** This IS the central mechanism of PDTP.

Constructive interference = phases aligned = alpha near 1 = strong gravity.
Destructive interference = phases opposed = alpha near 0 = weak/no gravity.

```
Constructive:   psi ≈ phi    →   cos(psi - phi) ≈ 1    →   full gravity
Destructive:    psi - phi ≈ pi/2   →   cos(psi - phi) ≈ 0   →   no gravity
```

In PDTP, gravity is literally the constructive interference between
matter-waves and spacetime-waves. Decoupling is destructive interference.

**PDTP Original:** Gravitational interaction = constructive phase
interference between matter and spacetime fields.

**Cross-ref:** Part 28b §5 (decoupling = crossed polarizers).

**Confidence:** High — this is the core PDTP claim.

---

### Effect 20: Superposition principle — LINEAR REGIME

**PDTP connection:** Approximate.

PDTP's field equation is nonlinear (the sin function):

```
Box phi = Sum_i g_i sin(psi_i - phi)
```

Superposition is only exact in the linearized regime (small phase
differences), where sin(x) ≈ x. For strong fields (large phase
differences near compact objects), superposition breaks down — PDTP
predicts nonlinear corrections.

**PDTP Original:** Superposition is approximate in PDTP, broken by the
cosine nonlinearity. This distinguishes PDTP from linearized GR.

**Cross-ref:** Part 14 (strong-field EP — cosine saturation).

**Confidence:** High — the nonlinearity is built into the theory.

---

### Effect 21: Beats — PHASE DRIFT (DARK ENERGY)

**PDTP connection:** Profound and unexpected.

Beats occur when two nearly-matched frequencies interfere. In PDTP, if
the spacetime field phi and matter field psi have slightly different
natural frequencies, their phase difference drifts slowly:

```
psi - phi = delta_omega * t     (slow drift)
alpha(t) = cos(delta_omega * t)     (oscillating coupling)
```

This slow phase drift is **exactly the mechanism behind PDTP's dark
energy prediction** (Part 25). The cosmic acceleration arises because
the average coupling weakens over cosmic time as the phases slowly
decohere.

**PDTP Original:** Cosmic dark energy = gravitational beats between
matter and spacetime fields with slightly mismatched frequencies.

**Cross-ref:** Part 25 (w(z) from phase drift), Part 26 (free parameter m).

**Confidence:** Medium — reproduces w(z) qualitatively, but the
beat frequency (parameter m) is not yet derived from first principles.
Self-consistency gives m = 6 epsilon (Part 26).

---

### Effect 22: Resonance — MASS GENERATION

**PDTP connection:** Direct.

In PDTP, a particle's mass is determined by how strongly it resonates
with the condensate. The coupling constant g_i sets how much energy is
stored in the phase-locking between particle i and spacetime:

```
Rest energy:   E_0 = g_i     (at exact resonance)
Mass:          m_i = g_i / c^2
```

Stronger phase-locking = more energy stored = more mass. This is
why massless particles (photons) are those that propagate without
phase-locking to the condensate.

**PDTP Original:** Particle mass = resonance energy of phase-locking
with the spacetime condensate.

**Cross-ref:** Part 21 §5 (mass from phase distortion).

**Confidence:** Medium — qualitatively clear, but the mechanism that
sets individual g_i values is not yet derived.

---

## 2.5 Polarization Effects in PDTP

### Effects 23-25: Linear, Circular, Elliptical Polarization — GW POLARIZATION STATES

**PDTP connection:** Direct, via the vector lattice (Part 28).

The two transverse modes of the PDTP lattice correspond to two
independent linear polarizations of gravitational waves. Circular
and elliptical polarizations are superpositions of these two modes
with different phase offsets — exactly as in electromagnetism.

```
Linear:      h = h_+ e_+ + 0 * e_x           (one mode only)
Circular:    h = h_0 (e_+ + i * e_x)          (both modes, 90 deg offset)
Elliptical:  h = h_1 e_+ + h_2 e^{i delta} e_x   (general)
```

**PDTP Original:** GW polarization states are phonon polarization states
of the spacetime lattice — same formalism as EM polarization.

**Cross-ref:** Part 28 §6 (mode mapping), Part 28b §2 (LIGO as
polarization filter).

**Confidence:** High — standard polarization algebra applies to any
transverse wave, including lattice phonons.

---

### Effect 26: Birefringence — SPACETIME BIREFRINGENCE (PREDICTION)

**PDTP connection:** This is a falsifiable prediction.

Birefringence means different polarizations travel at different speeds.
In PDTP, longitudinal (breathing) and transverse (tensor) modes have
different dispersion relations:

```
Transverse:     omega = c |k|                  (massless, speed c)
Longitudinal:   omega^2 = c^2 k^2 + omega_gap^2   (massive, speed > c for group velocity)
```

This is spacetime birefringence: the spacetime condensate splits
gravitational waves by polarization, just as calcite splits light.

**PDTP Original:** PDTP predicts spacetime birefringence between tensor
and scalar GW modes. The arrival time difference for a source at
distance d:

```
Delta_T = d * |1/c_L - 1/c_T|
```

**Source:** [Birefringence — Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birefringence)

**Cross-ref:** Part 28b §4.4 (spacetime birefringence prediction),
falsifiable_predictions.md §Prediction 2.

**Confidence:** High — the prediction is unambiguous. Whether it's
detectable depends on the (unknown) mass gap omega_gap.

---

### Effect 27: Dichroism — SELECTIVE MODE ABSORPTION

**PDTP connection:** Speculative but interesting.

Dichroism is selective absorption of one polarization. In PDTP, the
cos(psi - phi) coupling only affects the longitudinal (breathing) mode —
the transverse modes are massless and unaffected. This means the
condensate preferentially damps the breathing mode while letting tensor
modes propagate freely.

The mass gap acts as a frequency-dependent filter: breathing mode
frequencies below omega_gap are exponentially damped (evanescent), while
tensor modes pass freely at all frequencies.

**PDTP Original:** The spacetime condensate acts as a dichroic medium
for gravitational waves — absorbing the breathing mode preferentially.

**Cross-ref:** Part 28b §4 (mass gap as filter).

**Confidence:** Medium — qualitatively clear from the dispersion
relations.

## 2.6 Frequency and Velocity Effects in PDTP

### Effect 28: Dispersion — LATTICE DISPERSION (PREDICTION)

**PDTP connection:** Direct and falsifiable.

Any discrete lattice has dispersion at short wavelengths. The PDTP
lattice dispersion relation modifies the continuum result:

```
Continuum:   omega = c |k|
Lattice:     omega = (2c / a) sin(k a / 2)
```

where a is the lattice spacing. At long wavelengths (k a << 1), these
agree. At short wavelengths near the Planck scale (k a ~ 1), the lattice
relation curves over and the speed drops.

**PDTP Original:** Planck-scale lattice dispersion gives a speed
reduction: v = c * cos(ka/2). This is falsifiable via gamma-ray burst
timing.

**Source:** [Dispersion relation — Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersion_relation)

**Cross-ref:** falsifiable_predictions.md §Prediction 6.

**Confidence:** Medium — standard lattice physics, but the lattice
spacing a is assumed to be near the Planck length (~10^{-35} m).

---

### Effect 29: Doppler effect — GRAVITATIONAL REDSHIFT (ALTERNATIVE VIEW)

**PDTP connection:** Natural reinterpretation.

The gravitational redshift — light losing frequency as it climbs out of a
gravitational well — can be understood in PDTP as a Doppler-like effect.
The condensate flow near a massive object creates an effective velocity
field (analogous to a current in a superfluid). Light waves traveling
against this flow are Doppler-shifted to lower frequencies.

**Source:** [Gravitational redshift — Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_redshift)

**Cross-ref:** Part 24 (Painleve-Gullstrand coordinates — condensate flow).

**Confidence:** High — this is the standard analogue gravity
interpretation (Unruh 1981).

---

### Effects 30-31: Group velocity vs Phase velocity — MASSIVE MODE SUPERLUMINALITY

**PDTP connection:** Important subtlety.

For the massive breathing mode:

```
Phase velocity:   v_p = omega / k = c * sqrt(1 + omega_gap^2 / (c^2 k^2))   > c
Group velocity:   v_g = d omega / dk = c^2 k / omega   < c
```

The phase velocity exceeds c, but the group velocity (which carries
energy and information) is always below c. This is standard relativistic
dispersion — the same as for massive Klein-Gordon fields.

**Source:** [Group velocity — Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_velocity)
**Source:** [Phase velocity — Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_velocity)

**Cross-ref:** Part 28 §6 (dispersion relations).

**Confidence:** High — standard result for any massive field.

---

## 2.7 Nonlinear and Advanced Effects in PDTP

### Effect 32: Harmonics — HIGHER-ORDER PHASE COUPLING

**PDTP connection:** Present in the full theory.

The cosine coupling can be expanded in a Fourier series. Higher harmonics
correspond to multi-phonon processes in the lattice:

```
cos(psi - phi) = 1 - (psi - phi)^2/2 + (psi - phi)^4/24 - ...
```

The quartic term represents two-phonon scattering, the sixth-order term
three-phonon, etc. These are the "overtones" of the gravitational
interaction.

**PDTP Original:** Gravitational harmonics arise from the Taylor expansion
of the cosine coupling — they represent multi-graviton interactions.

**Confidence:** Medium — the nonlinear terms exist but are extremely
weak for normal gravity (psi - phi << 1).

---

### Effect 33: Solitons — TOPOLOGICAL PARTICLES

**PDTP connection:** Deep and physically significant.

The sine-Gordon equation (which is the 1D version of the PDTP field
equation) is famous for supporting soliton solutions — kink and antikink
configurations where the phase winds by 2 pi.

```
phi_soliton(x) = 4 arctan(exp(x / lambda))     (phase kink)
```

In PDTP, these solitons are **topologically stable excitations** of the
condensate. They cannot decay because the phase winding is quantized.
This could be the mechanism behind topological particle quantum numbers
(baryon number, lepton number).

**Source:** [Soliton — Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soliton)
**Source:** [Sine-Gordon equation — Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine-Gordon_equation)

**Cross-ref:** Part 1 §3.4 (sine-Gordon connection).

**Confidence:** Medium — the math works in 1D, extension to 3D is an
open problem.

---

### Effect 34: Shock waves — BLACK HOLE FORMATION

**PDTP connection:** Speculative but suggestive.

A shock wave forms when a source exceeds the wave speed. In PDTP, black
hole formation could be understood as the creation of a "gravitational
shock" — a region where the condensate flow speed exceeds the local
sound speed (speed of light). This is precisely the acoustic horizon
picture of Part 24.

```
Black hole condition:   v_flow(r) >= c_local(r)     (supersonic flow)
```

**PDTP Original:** Black hole formation = gravitational shock wave in the
condensate, where the flow becomes supersonic.

**Cross-ref:** Part 24 §3 (acoustic horizon).

**Confidence:** Medium — supported by the analogue gravity literature.

---

### Effect 35: Modulation — GRAVITATIONAL WAVE SIGNALS

**PDTP connection:** Direct analogy.

Binary inspiral gravitational waves are naturally frequency-modulated (FM):
the orbital frequency increases as the binary spirals inward, sweeping
the GW frequency upward (the "chirp"). In PDTP, this is FM of the
condensate oscillation driven by the shrinking orbit.

**Confidence:** High — standard GW physics applies directly.

---

### Effect 36: Wave mixing — GRAVITON-GRAVITON SCATTERING

**PDTP connection:** Present via nonlinearity.

The cosine nonlinearity in the PDTP field equation means gravitational
waves interact with each other — two incoming GWs can produce new
frequencies. This is the wave-mixing analogue of graviton-graviton
scattering in quantum gravity.

```
sin(psi - phi) ≈ (psi - phi) - (psi - phi)^3/6 + ...
```

The cubic term mediates three-wave mixing. This is extremely weak at
normal amplitudes but becomes significant near black holes.

**Cross-ref:** Part 1 §3 (field equation nonlinearity).

**Confidence:** Medium — the mechanism exists but is quantitatively
tiny for astrophysical GWs.

---

### Effect 37: Parametric amplification — SUPERRADIANCE

**PDTP connection:** Speculative.

Superradiance — the amplification of waves scattering off rotating black
holes — could be understood as parametric amplification in PDTP. The
rotating condensate provides a "pump" that transfers energy to incoming
waves.

**Source:** [Superradiance — Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superradiance)

**Confidence:** Low — not yet derived in PDTP. This is an open problem.

---

## 2.8 Quantum Wave Effects in PDTP

### Effect 38: Wave-particle duality — THE CORE IDENTITY

**PDTP connection:** This is not an analogy. It IS PDTP.

PDTP takes wave-particle duality literally: particles **are** waves.
Specifically, particles are localized phase distortions in the condensate
field. The "particle" aspect arises from the localization; the "wave"
aspect is the underlying reality.

```
Particle = standing wave in psi field, phase-locked to phi field
Wave = the psi field itself
```

There is no separate particle ontology — only fields with phases.

**Cross-ref:** Part 21 §5 (mass from phase distortion).

**Confidence:** High — this is the foundational claim of PDTP.

---

### Effect 39: Double-slit interference — PHASE FIELD SELF-INTERFERENCE

**PDTP connection:** Natural.

In PDTP, a particle passing through two slits is a wave in psi that
splits and recombines. The interference pattern comes from the phase
difference accumulated along the two paths. This is standard wave
mechanics — PDTP adds that the same pattern applies to the
**gravitational** coupling:

```
alpha at screen = cos(psi_path1 - phi) + cos(psi_path2 - phi)
```

The gravitational coupling of the particle would also show an interference
pattern — though it would be immeasurably small.

**PDTP Original:** Gravitational coupling should exhibit double-slit
interference — a testable (if impractical) prediction.

**Confidence:** High in principle, effectively untestable in practice.

---

### Effect 40: Aharonov-Bohm effect — PHASE IS PHYSICALLY REAL

**PDTP connection:** Strong philosophical support.

The Aharonov-Bohm effect proves that quantum phase is not just a
mathematical convenience — it has measurable physical consequences even
when the classical fields vanish. This is exactly PDTP's claim: the
phase fields phi and psi are the fundamental physical variables, not
derived quantities.

```
AB phase shift:   delta_psi = (e / hbar) * integral A . dl
PDTP coupling:    alpha = cos(psi - phi)     (phase difference is physical)
```

**Source:** [Aharonov-Bohm effect — Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aharonov%E2%80%93Bohm_effect)

**Cross-ref:** Part 28b §3 (alpha as U(1) projection).

**Confidence:** High — the AB effect is established physics that
supports PDTP's ontology of phase-as-fundamental.

---

### Effect 41: Quantum tunneling — PHASE PENETRATION THROUGH BARRIERS

**PDTP connection:** Natural wave phenomenon.

In PDTP, tunneling is simply the evanescent tail of a wave extending
through a region where propagating solutions don't exist. For the massive
breathing mode below the frequency gap:

```
Below omega_gap:   k^2 = (omega^2 - omega_gap^2) / c^2   < 0   (imaginary k)
```

The wave amplitude decays as exp(-|k| x) — it tunnels through the
forbidden region. This is the same mechanism as electromagnetic
evanescent waves in waveguides below cutoff.

**PDTP Original:** The breathing mode tunneling length lambda_tunnel =
c / sqrt(omega_gap^2 - omega^2) is a measurable quantity if omega_gap
can be determined.

**Confidence:** High — standard wave physics of massive fields.

---

### Effect 42: De Broglie wavelength — MATTER WAVE PHASE GRADIENT

**PDTP connection:** Foundational.

In PDTP, the de Broglie relation lambda = h/p is a statement about the
phase gradient of the matter wave field psi:

```
p = hbar * |grad psi|
lambda = 2 pi / |grad psi|
```

Faster particles have steeper phase gradients (shorter wavelengths).
The de Broglie wavelength is the spatial period of the phase field.

**Source:** [Matter wave — Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter_wave)

**Cross-ref:** Part 1 §1.5 (de Broglie connection).

**Confidence:** High — standard quantum mechanics, reinterpreted as
literal phase gradient.

---

## 2.9 Mechanical and Medium Effects in PDTP

### Effect 43: Attenuation — GRAVITATIONAL WAVE DAMPING

**PDTP connection:** Direct.

Gravitational waves lose energy as they propagate through the condensate
if there is any dissipation mechanism (viscosity of the quantum vacuum).
In standard GR, gravitational waves propagate without attenuation in
vacuum. PDTP could differ if the condensate has a small but nonzero
viscosity.

**PDTP Original:** Any measurable GW attenuation beyond geometric
(1/r) spreading would be evidence for condensate dissipation — and
for PDTP.

**Confidence:** Low — no specific prediction for the viscosity yet.

---

### Effect 44: Absorption — MASSIVE MODE EVANESCENCE

**PDTP connection:** Direct for the breathing mode.

Below the frequency gap omega_gap, the massive breathing mode is
evanescent — it decays exponentially. This IS absorption: the condensate
converts the wave energy into phase-locking energy. The decay length is:

```
lambda_decay = c / omega_gap
```

Tensor modes (massless) are never absorbed — they propagate freely.

**PDTP Original:** The breathing mode has a frequency-dependent absorption
length set by the mass gap.

**Cross-ref:** Part 28b §4 (mass gap as filter).

**Confidence:** High — standard physics of massive fields.

---

### Effect 45: Scattering — GRAVITATIONAL WAVE LENSING

**PDTP connection:** Standard physics in condensate language.

GW scattering off density inhomogeneities in the condensate corresponds
to gravitational lensing of GWs — an established GR prediction now being
tested with LIGO.

**Confidence:** High — same prediction as GR.

---

### Effect 46: Impedance matching — FINE STRUCTURE CONSTANT

**PDTP connection:** Already derived in Part 16.

The fine structure constant alpha_EM was reinterpreted in Part 16 as
the ratio of vacuum impedance Z_0 to the matter-wave impedance R_K
(von Klitzing constant):

```
alpha_EM = Z_0 / (2 R_K)     (impedance ratio)
```

The fact that alpha_EM << 1 means matter and vacuum are severely
impedance-mismatched — most of the "electromagnetic wave" reflects
back at the boundary. This is why electromagnetic interactions are
so much weaker than the condensate's internal stiffness.

**Cross-ref:** fine_structure_derivation.md §3 (impedance interpretation).

**Confidence:** Medium — the numerical relation is exact (established
physics), the PDTP interpretation is speculative.

---

### Effect 47: Mode conversion — LONGITUDINAL-TRANSVERSE COUPLING

**PDTP connection:** Important and underexplored.

At boundaries or strong field gradients, longitudinal (breathing) modes
could convert to transverse (tensor) modes and vice versa. In
crystallography, this is standard. In PDTP, this would mean:

```
Breathing mode → tensor GW     (mode conversion at a boundary)
```

This could happen at the surface of neutron stars or near black holes
where field gradients are extreme.

**PDTP Original:** Mode conversion between breathing and tensor modes
at strong-field boundaries is a specific, testable PDTP prediction.

**Confidence:** Low — not yet computed. Potentially important for
multi-messenger astronomy.

---

## 2.10 Exotic and Relativistic Wave Phenomena in PDTP

### Effect 48: Gravitational waves — THE PRIMARY PREDICTION

**PDTP connection:** The main subject of Parts 27-28.

PDTP predicts 3 GW branches:
- 2 transverse (tensor, massless) — matches LIGO observations
- 1 longitudinal (scalar, massive) — new prediction

```
Tensor: omega = c |k|             (h_+ and h_x, as observed)
Scalar: omega^2 = c^2 k^2 + omega_gap^2    (breathing, not yet observed)
```

**Cross-ref:** Part 28 (full derivation), falsifiable_predictions.md
§Prediction 1.

**Confidence:** High — the tensor prediction matches observations; the
scalar prediction is testable.

---

### Effect 49: Cherenkov radiation — SUPERLUMINAL PHASE EMISSION

**PDTP connection:** Fascinating possibility.

Cherenkov radiation occurs when a particle moves faster than the phase
velocity in a medium. In PDTP, if a particle could move faster than
some mode's phase velocity (which for the massive breathing mode
can be less than c at certain frequencies), it would emit that mode
as Cherenkov-like radiation.

```
Cherenkov condition:   v_particle > v_phase(omega)
For breathing mode:    v_phase = omega / k → c as k → infinity
```

For ultra-high-energy cosmic rays interacting with the massive breathing
mode, this could produce a novel energy loss mechanism.

**PDTP Original:** Gravitational Cherenkov radiation of the breathing
mode could limit the maximum energy of cosmic rays — providing an
independent test of the mass gap.

**Source:** [Cherenkov radiation — Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherenkov_radiation)

**Confidence:** Low — speculative, needs quantitative computation.

---

### Effect 50: Redshift / Blueshift — COSMOLOGICAL PHASE DRIFT

**PDTP connection:** Direct.

Cosmological redshift in PDTP is the stretching of wavelengths as the
condensate itself expands. Gravitational redshift is the change in wave
speed near massive objects (condensate compression). Both are standard
wave effects in a medium with changing properties.

The PDTP-specific addition: the dark energy equation of state w(z)
includes a correction from phase drift, giving w > -1:

```
w = (epsilon - 1) / (epsilon + 1)     where epsilon = g_eff / (9 H^2)
```

**Source:** [Redshift — Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift)

**Cross-ref:** Part 25 (w(z) derivation), Part 26 (parameter m).

**Confidence:** Medium — matches current DESI data qualitatively.

## What This Catalog Reveals

Three patterns emerge from mapping all 50 wave effects to PDTP:

1. **PDTP naturally accommodates most wave phenomena** because it IS a
   wave theory. Effects 1-13, 18-20, 28-31, 38-42 all map directly with
   no additional assumptions.

2. **Several "different" GR phenomena are the same wave effect** in PDTP:
   - Gravitational lensing = refraction (Effect 15)
   - Event horizons = total internal reflection (Effect 16)
   - Gravitational redshift = Doppler in flowing condensate (Effect 29)
   - Dark energy = beats / phase drift (Effect 21)

3. **Open problems cluster in nonlinear and boundary effects** (Effects 3,
   34, 36, 37, 47, 49). These are the hard problems of any condensed
   matter theory — computing the behavior at strong gradients and
   boundaries. They represent the frontier of PDTP development.
