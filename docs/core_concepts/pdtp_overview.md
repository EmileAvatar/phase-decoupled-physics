# Phase-Decoupled Transport Platform (PDTP)

A conceptual vehicle that moves by reducing and shaping its phase coupling
to spacetime rather than using thrust.

---

## Core Principle

Gravity is interpreted as:

Phase-locking between matter-waves and spacetime-waves.

Inertia arises from the same coupling.

By weakening this lock:

- Gravity decreases
- Inertia decreases

---

## PDTP Definition

A Phase-Decoupled Transport Platform:

- Maintains highly coherent internal matter-waves
- Actively controls internal phase alignment
- Alters coupling strength with spacetime

The vehicle does not push against air or space.

## PDTP High-Level Architecture

- Coherence Core
- Phase Control Layer
- Spacetime Phase Sensors
- Coupling Suppression Envelope
- Energy & Stability System

---

## Coherence Core

Purpose:
- Maintain macroscopic quantum coherence

Functions:
- Synchronizes internal wave states
- Prevents decoherence

Conceptual analogs:
- Superconductors
- Bose–Einstein condensates
- Superfluids

---

## Phase Control Layer

Purpose:
- Adjust internal phase relationships

Functions:
- Slight phase shifts
- Frequency stabilization
- Phase locking control

---

## Spacetime Phase Sensors

Purpose:
- Detect local spacetime phase gradients

Functions:
- Gravity gradient mapping
- Orientation reference
- Feedback input

---

## Coupling Suppression Envelope

Purpose:
- Region of reduced spacetime interaction

Functions:
- Weakens gravity coupling
- Weakens inertial coupling
- Provides hover capability

---

## Energy & Stability System

Purpose:
- Power coherence maintenance
- Power control electronics

Note:
Energy is not used to lift mass.
Energy maintains coherence.

---

## Movement Modes

Hover:
- Reduce coupling

Ascend:
- Further reduce coupling

Descend:
- Increase coupling

Translate:
- Tilt phase gradient

Rotate:
- Rotate gradient orientation

Stop:
- Flatten gradient

---

## Why No Thrust

Newtonian propulsion requires reaction mass.

PDTP motion:
- Alters spacetime geometry
- Vehicle follows geometry

---

## Inertial Decoupling

Weak coupling results in:

- No internal G-forces
- Extreme acceleration capability
- Structural safety

---

## Disc-Shaped Craft Compatibility

Disc geometry supports:

- Symmetric field containment
- Toroidal field structures
- Central coherence core
- Peripheral phase actuators

---

## Engineering Challenges

- Macroscopic coherence stability
- Decoherence suppression
- Precision phase control
- Real-time feedback

---

## Development Path (Conceptual)

- Lab-scale coherence systems
- Coupling modulation experiments
- Static hover tests
- Controlled translation
- Free-flight platforms

---

## Safety Principles

- Never fully decouple
- Automatic re-lock systems
- Smooth gradient transitions

---

## Status

Conceptual framework only.
Not experimentally validated.
