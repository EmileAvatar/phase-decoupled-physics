# Renamed Physics Terms (Functional Naming System)

This document presents a functional renaming of fundamental physics concepts
to improve intuitive understanding.

The renaming emphasizes what things DO, not historical or arbitrary labels.

## Matter Building Blocks (formerly Quarks)

Matter building blocks are the smallest known components that combine
to form composite matter structures.

- Light-Core (Up Quark)
  - Lowest-mass positive-charge core component
  - Common in stable matter

- Heavy-Core (Down Quark)
  - Slightly heavier negative-charge core component
  - Common in stable matter

- Stable-Core (Charm Quark)
  - Higher-mass core with increased stability

- Unstable-Core (Strange Quark)
  - Tends toward decay
  - Appears in short-lived matter

- Ultra-Heavy-Core (Top Quark)
  - Extremely massive
  - Exists briefly

- Heavy-Stable-Core (Bottom Quark)
  - Heavy but longer-lived than top

## Composite Matter

- Positive Core Assembly (Proton)
  - Three-core object with net positive charge

- Neutral Core Assembly (Neutron)
  - Three-core object with no net charge

- Triple-Core Object (Baryon)
  - Any three-core particle

- Dual-Core Object (Meson)
  - Core + anti-core pair

## Free Matter Particles (formerly Leptons)

Particles that do not participate in Core Binding interaction.

- Charge Carrier (Electron)
  - Responsible for electricity and chemistry

- Heavy Charge Carrier (Muon)
  - Heavier version of electron

- Ultra-Heavy Charge Carrier (Tau)
  - Heaviest charge carrier

## Ghost Particles (formerly Neutrinos)

Extremely weakly interacting particles.

- Light Ghost Particle (Electron Neutrino)
- Medium Ghost Particle (Muon Neutrino)
- Heavy Ghost Particle (Tau Neutrino)

Properties:
- Very small mass
- Rarely interact with matter
- Pass through most objects

---

## Force Messengers (formerly Bosons)

Particles that transmit interactions.

- Light Messenger (Photon)
  - Transmits electromagnetic interaction

- Binding Messenger (Gluon)
  - Transmits core binding

- Weak Change Messenger (W Boson)
  - Enables particle type change

- Weak Balance Messenger (Z Boson)
  - Maintains weak interaction balance

- Mass Setter (Higgs Boson)
  - Enables mass acquisition

---

## Interactions (formerly Forces)

- Mass Attraction (Gravity)
  - Spacetime curvature interaction

- Charge Interaction (Electromagnetism)

- Core Binding (Strong Interaction)

- Matter Transformation (Weak Interaction)

---

## Background Systems (formerly Fields)

- Particle Generator (Quantum Fields)
  - Continuous fields that generate particles

- Mass Environment (Higgs Field)
  - Determines how particles acquire mass

- Motion Framework (Spacetime)
  - Geometric structure defining motion

---

## Antimatter (Mirror Matter)

- Mirror Charge Carrier (Positron)
- Mirror Proton
- Mirror Neutron

Mirror matter has opposite charge but identical mass.

## Conceptual Summary

Matter is composed of standing wave patterns.
Interactions occur through messenger waves.
Fields define what interactions are possible.
