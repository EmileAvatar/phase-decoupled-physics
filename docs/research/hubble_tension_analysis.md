# Hubble Tension Analysis in PDTP (Part 16)

**Status:** PDTP Original analysis (builds on established cosmology)

This document develops PDTP's interpretation of the Hubble tension —
the ~5σ discrepancy between local and CMB-inferred measurements of the
Hubble constant H₀. PDTP provides a physically motivated mechanism
(environment-dependent phase-locking) that naturally produces
direction-dependent expansion rates, but cannot yet predict the
magnitude without condensate microphysics.

## 1. The Hubble Tension

### 1.1 Statement of the Problem

The Hubble constant H₀ measures the current expansion rate of the
universe. Two independent methods give discrepant values:

### 1.2 Why It Matters

If the tension is real (not systematic error), it implies:

1. **New physics** beyond ΛCDM is needed
2. The expansion history is more complex than a single H₀ value
3. Either early-universe physics or late-universe physics (or both)
   differs from the standard model

The tension has persisted since ~2013 and has strengthened with
improved measurements. Multiple independent local methods (Cepheids,
tip of the red giant branch, surface brightness fluctuations,
gravitational lensing time delays) consistently give H₀ ~ 73,
while CMB + BAO consistently give H₀ ~ 67.

### 1.3 Standard Proposed Solutions

| Proposed Solution | Mechanism | Status |
|-------------------|-----------|--------|
| **Early dark energy** (EDE) | Extra energy density at z ~ 3000 reduces sound horizon, raising inferred H₀ | Partially viable; tension with other data |
| **Varying dark energy** w(z) | w ≠ −1 modifies late-time expansion | Can ease tension; not fully resolve |
| **Modified gravity** | Extra scalar field changes expansion history | Constrained by solar system tests |
| **Local void** | We live in an underdense region → faster local expansion | Debated; requires δ ~ −0.3 to −0.5 |
| **New neutrino physics** | Extra N_eff or self-interacting neutrinos | Constrained by BBN |
| **Systematic errors** | Calibration of distance ladder | Cannot explain all independent methods |
| **Primordial magnetic fields** (PMF, "bΛCDM") | Weak fields clump the pre-recombination plasma; recombination rate ∝ n_e n_p, so clumping makes recombination slightly earlier, shrinks the sound horizon, raises inferred H₀ | Partial relief; ~1.8σ (Planck+DESI) to ~3σ (+SH0ES) preference; see note below |

**Note — primordial magnetic fields (added 2026-10-17)** `[EXTERNAL]`

Mainstream result, recorded here for completeness. **No PDTP claim is
attached to it.** Values below are taken from the paper's Tables I–II.

- Field strength preferred: total comoving b_pmf ≈ 5–10 pG today
  (about 10× larger at recombination, z ≈ 1090); non-helical,
  Batchelor spectrum; one extra parameter beyond ΛCDM.
- H₀ (km/s/Mpc): ΛCDM Planck+DESI 67.88 ± 0.37 → bΛCDM Planck+DESI
  68.52 (+0.54/−0.62) → bΛCDM Planck+DESI+Pantheon+ with SH0ES
  calibration 69.93 (+0.53/−0.66). Disagreement with SH0ES
  (73.04 ± 1.04) falls to 2.7σ. **Partial relief, not a full resolution.**
- Planck+DESI χ² is equal to or better than ΛCDM's (worse Planck fit is
  offset by a better DESI fit). Partial S₈ relief as well; Ω_m tension
  with supernovae gets slightly worse (true of every
  modified-recombination model).
- 5 pG is also the minimum needed for galaxy-cluster fields to be purely
  primordial, with no dynamo amplification.
- Tests: Silk-damping-tail CMB spectra (SPT-3G, Simons Observatory),
  γ-ray halos around blazars (void fields ≳ 1 pG), Lyman-α forest.
- The paper does not say where the fields came from. Candidate origins
  it cites are inflation (needs new physics that breaks conformal
  invariance of electromagnetism) and early-universe phase transitions
  (Vachaspati 1991).

**Plain English:** if the early plasma carried very weak magnetic
fields, they stirred it into denser and thinner patches. Atoms form
faster in the dense patches, so the universe became see-through a little
earlier. That shrinks the "ruler" cosmologists read from the CMB, and a
smaller ruler implies faster expansion, closer to the local
measurement. Even the most favourable data combination closes only
about 40% of the gap (67.88 → 69.93, against 73.04 measured locally),
and the evidence is still only 2–3σ.

**PDTP relevance:** none yet. PDTP's own early-universe attempts to
shrink the sound horizon (§4.4; `hubble_tension_c1.md`: φ₋ as EDE is
9.4 orders too weak, the biharmonic correction is ~10⁻¹¹⁹) use the
same lever, so this is a competing mechanism, not support. The possible
PDTP hook is the *origin* of the fields (a Kibble–Zurek vortex
transition, Part 116), filed as TODO_05 T84. **Result (Part 159, 2026-11-07): NO-GO** with
PDTP's current fields. The only symmetry-allowed photon coupling
(axion-type φ·E·B) amplifies fields by αΔφ/4π e-folds, about 0.004 for the
Kibble–Zurek winding. See [pmf_pdtp_scoping.md](pmf_pdtp_scoping.md).

## 2. PDTP Framework for Cosmic Expansion

### 2.1 Expansion as Condensate Flow

In PDTP, cosmic expansion is identified with the superfluid velocity
field of the spacetime condensate (Part 8, §2.1):

```
v_i = H(t) x_i                                              ... (2.1)
```

The condensate density ρ₀(t) satisfies the continuity equation:

```
dρ₀/dt + 3H ρ₀ = 0    →    ρ₀ ∝ a⁻³                       ... (2.2)
```

And the condensate Euler equation gives the Raychaudhuri equation:

```
Ḣ + H² = −(4πG/3) ρ_m                                      ... (2.3)
```

**Source:** [radiation_era_cosmology.md](radiation_era_cosmology.md) §2.

**PDTP Original.** Cosmic expansion = condensate Hubble flow. The
Hubble parameter H(t) is the rate at which the condensate phase
gradient evolves.

### 2.2 The Two-Sector Structure

The extended PDTP (Part 12) has two gravitational sectors:

**Tensor sector (Einstein equation):**
```
G_μν = (8πG/c⁴) T_μν    →    H² = (8πG/3) ρ_total          ... (2.4)
```
This gives the standard Friedmann equation with ALL energy
contributions. It determines the *global* expansion rate.

**Scalar sector (phase equation):**
```
□_g φ = Σ gᵢ sin(ψᵢ − φ)                                   ... (2.5)
```
This governs the *local* phase-locking dynamics between matter
and spacetime. It depends on the local matter environment.

**Source:** [tetrad_extension.md](tetrad_extension.md) §5.5–5.6;
[radiation_era_cosmology.md](radiation_era_cosmology.md) §8.3.

### 2.3 Phase Drift Interpretation

In PDTP, the expansion rate is connected to the condensate phase
evolution. The global Hubble parameter H̄ is set by the tensor
sector (eq. 2.4) — this is the same as GR.

The scalar sector (eq. 2.5) adds local phase-locking dynamics that
depend on the matter environment. The *measured* local Hubble
parameter may differ from the global value because:

- **Phase-locking strength** varies with local matter density
- **Phase drift rate** depends on the balance between locking and
  drifting
- **The measurement itself** is affected by the local phase
  environment

**PDTP Original.** The Hubble tension is reinterpreted as a
discrepancy between the *global* Friedmann rate (tensor sector,
probed by CMB) and the *local* phase-modified rate (scalar + tensor,
probed by distance ladder).

## 3. Phase Drift Rate and Local Environment

### 3.1 The Phase Drift Equation

From the PDTP scalar field equation in an expanding universe:

```
d²φ/dt² + 3H(dφ/dt) = Σ gᵢ sin(ψᵢ − φ)                   ... (3.1)
```

**Source:** The d'Alembertian □_g in FRW spacetime adds a 3H friction
term; see [Friedmann equations — Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedmann_equations)
for the FRW metric used.

The right-hand side is the *phase-locking source*. It depends on:

1. **The coupling constants gᵢ** — proportional to the rest mass of
   each source (Part 9, §3): gᵢ ~ 4πRᵢ where Rᵢ is a geometric
   size parameter
2. **The local matter density** — the sum Σ gᵢ is proportional to
   ρ_local for a uniform distribution of matter
3. **The phase mismatch** sin(ψᵢ − φ) — for nearly synchronized
   matter, sin(ψᵢ − φ) ≈ ψᵢ − φ (weak-field limit)

**PDTP Original.** The effective locking strength in a region is:

```
G_eff = Σ gᵢ ∝ ρ_local                                     ... (3.2)
```

In an overdense region, G_eff is larger → phase-locking is stronger
→ the condensate phase is more tightly bound → drift is suppressed.

In an underdense region, G_eff is smaller → phase-locking is weaker
→ drift is enhanced → expansion appears faster.

### 3.2 Local Density Contrast

Define the density contrast:

```
δ = (ρ_local − ρ̄) / ρ̄                                      ... (3.3)
```

**Source:** [Cosmological perturbation theory — Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_perturbation_theory)

In standard linear perturbation theory, the local expansion rate
perturbation is:

```
δH/H̄ = −(1/3) f(Ω_m) δ                                    ... (3.4)
```

where f ≈ Ω_m^{0.55} is the growth rate factor.

**Source:** Peebles (1980), *The Large-Scale Structure of the Universe*,
Princeton University Press. The growth rate approximation
f ≈ Ω_m^{0.55} is from Linder (2005).

For Ω_m ≈ 0.3: f ≈ 0.53, giving:

```
δH/H̄ ≈ −0.18 δ                                             ... (3.5)
```

To produce the observed 8% tension (δH/H̄ ≈ +0.08) from a local
void requires:

```
δ ≈ −0.08/0.18 ≈ −0.44                                     ... (3.6)
```

This is a fairly deep local void. The KBC void (Keenan, Barger,
& Cowie 2013) suggests δ ≈ −0.3 to −0.5 extending to ~300 Mpc,
which is debated but observationally plausible.

Scale Under-density in the Local Galaxy Distribution," ApJ, 775, 62.

### 3.3 PDTP Enhancement: Nonlinear Phase-Locking

In standard perturbation theory, the local expansion rate depends
*linearly* on the density contrast (eq. 3.5). PDTP introduces a
qualitative enhancement through the nonlinear cosine coupling.

The phase drift rate depends on the *inverse* of the effective
locking strength. From equation (3.1), in the quasi-static limit
where d²φ/dt² ≈ 0:

```
3H (dφ/dt) ≈ G_eff sin(ψ − φ)                              ... (3.7)
```

The drift rate dφ/dt is determined by the balance between the Hubble
friction (left) and the locking source (right). For a region with
density contrast δ:

```
G_eff(δ) = G_eff^(0) (1 + δ)                                ... (3.8)
```

where G_eff^(0) is the cosmic mean locking strength.

The local phase drift rate is:

```
(dφ/dt)_local ∝ 1/(1 + δ)                                   ... (3.9)
```

For an underdense region (δ < 0):

```
(dφ/dt)_local / (dφ/dt)_mean = 1/(1 + δ)                    ... (3.10)
```

Expanding for small |δ|:

```
(dφ/dt)_local ≈ (dφ/dt)_mean × (1 − δ + δ² − ...)          ... (3.11)
```

The key difference from standard perturbation theory: the 1/(1+δ)
dependence introduces a **nonlinear amplification** for negative δ.
For a void with δ = −0.3:

```
Standard linear:     δH/H̄ ≈ −0.18 × (−0.3) = +0.054 → 5.4%
PDTP nonlinear:      δH/H̄ ≈ 1/(1−0.3) − 1 = 0.43 → up to 43%
```

The raw 1/(1+δ) overestimates because it assumes all of the
expansion rate comes from the scalar sector. In practice, the
tensor sector (eq. 2.4) dominates and is insensitive to local
density on sub-Hubble scales. The scalar correction is suppressed:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                              │
│  δH/H̄ ≈ ε_s × [1/(1+δ) − 1]                   ... (3.12) │
│                                                              │
│  where ε_s = scalar sector fraction of total H              │
│                                                              │
│  ε_s ≪ 1 (scalar sector is subdominant to tensor sector)   │
│                                                              │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**PDTP Original.** The nonlinear 1/(1+δ) dependence amplifies the
void effect relative to standard linear perturbation theory. Even
with the scalar suppression factor ε_s, a moderate void (δ ~ −0.3)
can produce a larger δH/H̄ than standard theory predicts.

### 3.4 Coherence Length and Scale Dependence

The PDTP condensate has a natural coherence length:

```
ξ = c / √(2g)                                               ... (3.13)
```

**Source:** [mathematical_formalization.md](mathematical_formalization.md)
§6.3 — the breathing mode dispersion relation ω² = k² + 2g gives
the Compton-like wavelength ξ = c/√(2g).

This coherence length sets the scale beyond which phase drift
dominates over local phase-locking:

- **r ≪ ξ:** Phase-locking dominates. Local structures (atoms,
  solar systems, galaxies) maintain internal coherence. No
  expansion.
- **r ~ ξ:** Transition regime. Phase-locking and drift compete.
  Local density affects the balance.
- **r ≫ ξ:** Drift dominates. Expansion proceeds at the global
  Friedmann rate.

If ξ ~ 100–300 Mpc, this provides a natural explanation for why:

1. Local measurements (r < 300 Mpc) probe the transition regime
   where density affects the drift rate
2. CMB measurements probe the global Friedmann rate (r ~ c/H₀ ~
   4400 Mpc), well beyond ξ
3. The Hubble tension emerges precisely at the scale where the
   transition from local locking to global drift occurs

**PDTP Original.** The coherence length ξ provides a natural scale
for the Hubble tension: measurements inside ξ see an
environment-dependent expansion rate, while measurements far beyond
ξ see the global rate. The tension arises because the two
measurement methods probe different sides of this transition.

### 3.5 Estimate of the Coherence Length

The coupling constant g is related to Newton's constant by
(Part 9, §2):

```
G = 𝒞 c^{5/2} / √(ℏ ρ₀)                                    ... (3.14)
```

The breathing mode mass is m_b = ℏ√(2g)/c², and the corresponding
Compton wavelength is:

```
λ_b = ℏ/(m_b c) = c/√(2g) = ξ                              ... (3.15)
```

From Part 3 (hard_problems.md §1.9), the breathing mode mass is
bounded by Cassini observations:

```
m_b > ℏ/(c × 2.4 AU) ≈ 3 × 10⁻²⁵ eV/c²
```

**Source:** [hard_problems.md](hard_problems.md) §1.9 — Cassini
bound on scalar field mass.

This gives an *upper* bound on ξ:

```
ξ < c/√(2g) < 2.4 AU                                        ... (3.16)
```

Wait — this is much smaller than 100 Mpc. The Cassini bound
constrains the *static* breathing mode Compton wavelength, which
sets ξ_static < 2.4 AU.

However, the cosmological coherence length may differ from the
static breathing mode wavelength. In the cosmological context:

1. The effective coupling g_cosmo may differ from g_local due to
   the cosmological density ρ̄ vs. solar system density
2. The cosmological coherence length involves the *collective*
   phase coherence of the condensate, not the single-mode Compton
   wavelength
3. The Cassini bound constrains the local propagating scalar mode,
   not the cosmological background coherence

**PDTP Original.** The distinction between the local breathing mode
wavelength (constrained by Cassini) and the cosmological coherence
length (relevant for the Hubble tension) requires careful analysis.
Two possibilities:

- **ξ_cosmo ≈ ξ_local:** Then the coherence length is very short
  (~AU scale) and PDTP cannot explain the Hubble tension via this
  mechanism
- **ξ_cosmo ≠ ξ_local:** The cosmological coherence involves
  long-wavelength collective modes of the condensate that are not
  constrained by Cassini. This is analogous to how a superfluid's
  bulk coherence length differs from its microscopic healing length

This is an **unresolved question** that requires either condensate
microphysics (Part 14) or a more detailed analysis of the
cosmological vs. local scalar field dynamics.

## 4. Quantitative Model

### 4.1 The Tensor-Scalar Decomposition

The locally measured Hubble rate in extended PDTP has two
contributions:

```
H²_local = H²_tensor + H²_scalar                            ... (4.1)
```

**Tensor sector:** The (0,0) component of the Einstein equation
gives:

```
H²_tensor = (8πG/3) ρ_local                                 ... (4.2)
```

For a region with density contrast δ:

```
H²_tensor = (8πG/3) ρ̄(1 + δ) = H̄²_tensor (1 + δ)          ... (4.3)
```

**Source:** This is the standard result from cosmological perturbation
theory. [Friedmann equations — Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedmann_equations)

Taking the square root:

```
H_tensor,local ≈ H̄_tensor (1 + δ/2)                         ... (4.4)
```

This gives δH/H̄ ≈ δ/2 from the tensor sector alone. For a local
void with δ = −0.16:

```
δH/H̄ = (−0.16)/2 = −0.08 → 8% deficit
```

But this goes the **wrong direction** — an underdense region has
*less* energy, so the Friedmann equation gives a *smaller* H.

### 4.2 The Resolution: Phase Drift Enhancement

The standard result (4.4) gives smaller H in an underdense region,
which is opposite to the observed tension (local H₀ is *higher*).

In GR, the resolution is subtle: the local void creates a
*peculiar velocity* toward the void boundary, and the distance
ladder interprets these peculiar velocities as part of the Hubble
flow, inflating the measured H₀. This is the Lemaître-Tolman-Bondi
(LTB) void model.

**Source:** [Lemaître-Tolman metric — Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lema%C3%AEtre%E2%80%93Tolman_metric)

In PDTP, there is an additional mechanism: the scalar sector
contributes to the *effective* expansion rate through phase drift.
In an underdense region, the weaker phase-locking allows the
condensate phase to drift *faster*, adding to the apparent
expansion:

```

│  • Scalar: less locking → faster phase drift → more         │
│    apparent expansion                                        │
│                                                              │
│  If scalar drift dominates the correction:                   │
│    H_measured > H̄  in an underdense region  ← correct sign │
│                                                              │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**PDTP Original.** The scalar sector's 1/ρ_local dependence can
produce a *positive* δH/H̄ in an underdense region, matching the
observed sign of the Hubble tension. This requires the scalar drift
contribution to exceed the tensor deficit, which depends on the
relative strength ε_s of the scalar sector.

### 4.3 Magnitude Estimate

The net local Hubble perturbation is:

```
δH/H̄ ≈ δ/2 + ε_s × [1/(1+δ) − 1]                          ... (4.5)
```

The first term (tensor) is negative for δ < 0.
The second term (scalar drift) is positive for δ < 0.

For the scalar term to dominate:

```
ε_s × [1/(1+δ) − 1] > |δ/2|

ε_s × |δ|/(1+δ) > |δ|/2

ε_s > (1+δ)/2                                               ... (4.6)
```

For δ = −0.3: ε_s > 0.35.

This requires the scalar sector to contribute at least ~35% of the
total Hubble rate — a significant but not implausible fraction.

**However:** From the double pulsar analysis (Part 13), the scalar
sector is *suppressed* relative to the tensor sector. The
Brans-Dicke parameter ω > 40,000 (Cassini), which means
ε_s < 1/(2ω+3) < 1.25 × 10⁻⁵.

**PDTP Original.** The naive scalar drift mechanism is too weak
to explain the Hubble tension, because the scalar sector is
suppressed by the Cassini bound ω > 40,000. The scalar contribution
to the cosmological expansion rate is at most ~10⁻⁵ of the tensor
contribution.

### 4.4 Alternative PDTP Mechanisms

The direct scalar drift mechanism (§4.3) fails quantitatively.
Are there other PDTP-specific mechanisms?

**Mechanism A: Cosmological vs. local scalar mass.**
The breathing mode mass m_b = ℏ√(2g)/c² may depend on the
cosmological epoch. If g was smaller in the early universe (weaker
coupling), the scalar sector would have been more significant,
potentially modifying the CMB-inferred H₀. This is analogous to
early dark energy (EDE) models.

**Mechanism B: Phase coherence decay.**
If the condensate's phase coherence degrades with time (cosmic
decoherence), the *effective* expansion rate would increase at
late times. This could produce a higher local H₀ compared to the
early-universe value. The challenge: quantifying the decoherence
rate requires condensate microphysics (Part 14).

**Mechanism C: Nonlinear condensate dynamics.**
The full nonlinear field equation (3.1) may produce effects that
go beyond the linearized scalar-tensor decomposition. In
particular, the cosmological phase evolution dφ/dt may couple to
density perturbations in a way that is not captured by the simple
ε_s parameter. This requires numerical solution of the coupled
field equations.

**Mechanism D: Phase-locking backreaction.**
The average of the phase-locking interaction over an inhomogeneous
universe may differ from the locking in a homogeneous universe.
This is analogous to the "backreaction" proposal in standard
cosmology (Buchert 2000). In PDTP, the nonlinear sin(ψ−φ)
coupling means ⟨sin(ψ−φ)⟩ ≠ sin(⟨ψ−φ⟩) — the average of the
coupling differs from the coupling of the average.

**Source:** Buchert (2000), "On Average Properties of Inhomogeneous
Fluids in General Relativity," GRG, 32, 105.

Of these, Mechanism D is the most promising because:
1. It does not require the scalar sector to be large (ε_s can be small)
2. It operates through the tensor sector (backreaction modifies the
   effective Friedmann equation)
3. The PDTP nonlinearity (cosine coupling) provides a specific
   backreaction term that is absent in standard GR

**PDTP Original.** Four candidate mechanisms identified. The direct
scalar drift (§4.3) is quantitatively insufficient. Backreaction
from nonlinear phase-locking (Mechanism D) is the most promising
avenue, but requires detailed calculation.

## 5. Comparison with Standard Solutions

| Proposed Solution | Mechanism | PDTP Analogue | Status in PDTP |
|-------------------|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| Early dark energy | Extra ρ at z ~ 3000 | Phase drift rate evolves with epoch | Qualitative only |
| Local void (LTB) | Underdensity → faster local expansion | Reduced phase-locking → faster drift | Scalar too weak (§4.3) |
| Varying w(z) | Dark energy equation of state evolves | Phase drift rate is dynamic | Natural but unquantified |
| Modified gravity | Extra scalar field modifies expansion | PDTP IS scalar-tensor theory | Scalar sector suppressed |
| Backreaction | Inhomogeneity modifies average expansion | Nonlinear phase-locking backreaction | Most promising (§4.4) |
| Systematic errors | Calibration issues | Not addressed | — |

**Key observation:** PDTP's most natural contribution is through
the backreaction channel — the nonlinear cosine coupling produces
a specific backreaction term that is absent in pure GR and distinct
from the standard Buchert backreaction.

## 6. The Backreaction Mechanism (Detailed)

### 6.1 Averaging the Phase-Locking Interaction

Consider the PDTP phase equation averaged over a large volume V:

```
⟨□_g φ⟩_V = ⟨Σ gᵢ sin(ψᵢ − φ)⟩_V                         ... (6.1)
```

In a homogeneous universe, ψᵢ − φ ≈ 0 for all matter (perfect
phase-locking), so:

```
Homogeneous: ⟨sin(ψ − φ)⟩ = sin(0) = 0                     ... (6.2)
```

In an inhomogeneous universe, matter in overdense regions has
ψ − φ > 0 (compressed, slightly ahead in phase), while matter
in underdense regions has ψ − φ < 0 (stretched, slightly behind):

```
Inhomogeneous: ⟨sin(ψ − φ)⟩ ≠ 0 in general                 ... (6.3)
```

More importantly, the *variance* of ψ − φ matters. For a
distribution of phase mismatches with variance σ²:

```
⟨cos(ψ − φ)⟩ = cos(⟨ψ−φ⟩) × exp(−σ²/2)                   ... (6.4)
```

**Source:** This follows from the characteristic function of a
Gaussian distribution. [Normal distribution — Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution)
(characteristic function section).

The factor exp(−σ²/2) means the *effective* phase-locking is
WEAKER in an inhomogeneous universe than in a homogeneous one.

### 6.2 Effective Coupling Reduction

The effective coupling in an inhomogeneous region is:

```
α_eff = ⟨cos(ψ − φ)⟩ = α₀ × exp(−σ²_δψ/2)                 ... (6.5)
```

where σ²_δψ is the variance of phase mismatches.

**PDTP Original.** The phase mismatch variance σ²_δψ is related to
the density variance σ²_δ through the phase-density connection
(Part 10, §2):

```
δψ ~ Ξ = GM/(Rc²) = compactness                             ... (6.6)
```

For cosmological density perturbations, the typical phase mismatch
is related to the gravitational potential:

```
δψ ~ Φ_N/c² ~ 10⁻⁵                                         ... (6.7)
```

**Source:** The CMB temperature anisotropy ΔT/T ~ 10⁻⁵ corresponds
to gravitational potential fluctuations Φ/c² ~ 10⁻⁵.
[Cosmic microwave background — Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background)

This gives:

```
σ²_δψ ~ (10⁻⁵)² = 10⁻¹⁰                                    ... (6.8)

α_eff ≈ α₀ × (1 − 10⁻¹⁰/2) ≈ α₀ × (1 − 5×10⁻¹¹)         ... (6.9)
```

The effective coupling reduction is ~10⁻¹⁰ — far too small to
produce the 8% Hubble tension.

```

**PDTP Original.** Both the direct scalar drift mechanism (§4.3)
and the backreaction mechanism (§6.2) produce effects that are
many orders of magnitude too small to explain the Hubble tension.
The fundamental reason: phase mismatches in the current universe
are of order Φ/c² ~ 10⁻⁵, and the Cassini bound suppresses the
scalar sector to ~10⁻⁵ of the tensor sector.

## 7. What PDTP Can and Cannot Say About the Hubble Tension

### 7.1 What PDTP Cannot Do (Currently)

1. **Cannot explain the 8% H₀ discrepancy** through any mechanism
   analyzed in this document
2. **Cannot compute the scalar sector fraction ε_s** without
   condensate microphysics
3. **Cannot determine the cosmological coherence length** without
   knowing the vacuum coupling constant g
4. **Cannot predict whether H₀ should vary with environment** at
   a level detectable by current surveys

### 7.2 What PDTP Does Offer

1. **A natural framework** where expansion rate variations are
   conceptually expected (phase drift depends on environment)
2. **A specific nonlinearity** (cosine coupling) that produces
   backreaction terms absent in GR
3. **A prediction structure** — IF the Hubble tension has a
   gravitational explanation, PDTP predicts it should correlate
   with the phase-locking environment (matter density, coherence)
4. **A connection** between the Hubble tension, dark energy, and
   the phase drift mechanism — all three may have the same origin
   in condensate dynamics

### 7.3 The Deep Connection: Hubble Tension, Dark Energy, and Phase Drift

All three cosmological open problems in PDTP share a common root:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                              │
│  Common root: What controls the condensate phase drift rate? │
│                                                              │
│  → Dark energy: the GLOBAL drift rate = Λ                   │
│  → Hubble tension: LOCAL vs GLOBAL drift rate = δH₀         │
│  → Phase drift mechanism: WHAT DRIVES the drift = ?         │
│                                                              │
│  All three require the same missing ingredient:              │
│  condensate microphysics (Part 14)                           │
│                                                              │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**PDTP Original.** The Hubble tension, cosmological constant, and
phase drift mechanism are three aspects of the same underlying
question: what determines the condensate's coherence evolution?
Answering any one of them constrains the others.

---

## 8. Testable Predictions (Conditional)

Even without resolving the Hubble tension, PDTP makes conditional
predictions:

### 8.1 IF the scalar sector is relevant to the Hubble tension

Then PDTP predicts:

1. **H₀ should correlate with local matter density** — surveys
   measuring H₀ in different environments should find systematic
   variations
2. **The correlation should be nonlinear** — underdense regions
   should show a larger deviation than overdense regions (from the
   1/(1+δ) dependence)
3. **There should be a characteristic scale** ξ beyond which the
   correlation disappears (the coherence length)
4. **The breathing mode GW** (if detected) would provide an
   independent measurement of the scalar sector strength

### 8.2 IF the Hubble tension is due to systematics

Then PDTP predicts:

1. **H₀ should NOT vary with local density** beyond the standard
   perturbation theory prediction
2. **The scalar sector should be undetectable** in cosmological
   data (consistent with Cassini bound)
3. **PDTP cosmology = GR cosmology** at all accessible scales

### 8.3 Future Observational Tests

| Test | Survey/Instrument | What it probes |
|------|-------------------|---------------|
| Environment-dependent H₀ | DESI, Euclid, Roman | Whether H₀ varies with local density |
| Breathing mode GW | LISA, Einstein Telescope | Scalar sector strength |
| Local void measurement | Galaxy redshift surveys | Density contrast δ at 100-300 Mpc |
| H₀ at intermediate redshifts | JWST, gravitational wave sirens | Whether tension evolves with z |

## 9. Summary

### What has been derived

| Result | Type | Status |
|--------|------|--------|
| Phase drift equation in expanding universe | **PDTP Original** | Derived from □_g φ (§3.1) |
| Scalar drift rate ∝ 1/ρ_local (nonlinear enhancement) | **PDTP Original** | From phase equation (§3.3) |
| Scalar sector suppressed by Cassini bound (ε_s < 10⁻⁵) | **PDTP Original** | From ω > 40,000 (§4.3) |
| Direct scalar drift mechanism: quantitatively insufficient | **PDTP Original** | ~10⁻⁵ effect vs. 8% needed (§4.3) |
| Backreaction from phase inhomogeneity: also insufficient | **PDTP Original** | ~10⁻¹⁰ effect (§6.3) |
| Deep connection: Hubble tension ↔ dark energy ↔ phase drift | **PDTP Original** | Common root identified (§7.3) |
| Conditional predictions for future surveys | **PDTP Original** | Testable structure (§8) |

### Honest assessment

**PDTP cannot currently explain the Hubble tension.** Both
mechanisms analyzed (direct scalar drift, backreaction from phase
inhomogeneity) produce effects that are many orders of magnitude
too small. The fundamental constraint is the Cassini bound
(ω > 40,000), which suppresses the scalar sector to negligible
levels in cosmological dynamics.

**What PDTP does offer** is a framework where the Hubble tension,
dark energy, and the phase drift mechanism are connected — all
three probe the condensate's coherence evolution. If the
condensate microphysics (Part 14) eventually determines the
drift dynamics, it would simultaneously address all three problems.

**The most important lesson:** PDTP's scalar sector, while
providing the *mechanism* for gravity (phase-locking), is too
weak to modify the *rate* of cosmological expansion at detectable
levels. The tensor sector (Einstein equation) dominates cosmology,
as shown in Part 15 for the BBN era and confirmed here for the
Hubble tension.

**Status:** Honest analysis completed. The Hubble tension remains
genuinely open in PDTP — not because we haven't tried, but because
the framework's own consistency (Cassini bound, scalar suppression)
prevents the scalar sector from producing effects large enough to
matter cosmologically.
