## Plain English Summary

The two-phase Lagrangian (Part 61) has **two** phase gaps instead of one. The
"gravity gap" Δ₊ = ψ − φ₊ works exactly like the single-phase gap from T1–T8
(same refractive index, same Brewster angle, same noise divergence). But there is
also a "surface gap" Δ₋ = φ₋ that encodes the state of the surface condensate mode.

The key finding is that the coupling between matter and spacetime is the **product**
sin(Δ₊)·sin(Δ₋). In everyday language: gravity requires **both** modes to be engaged.
The surface mode (φ₋) is like a second switch in series with the gravity switch (φ₊).

Near any gravitating body, φ₋ flips to its "on" state (Δ₋ = π/2) within a few
nanometres of the matter source. After that, the two-phase system behaves exactly
like the single-phase system — all of T1–T8 carry over unchanged.

**The surprising result:** When someone tries to "turn off gravity" by driving
Δ₊ → π/2 (the single-phase Leidenfrost point), the two-phase system does the
**opposite** of what you want: it maximises the surface channel coupling
(sin(Δ₊) → 1 means L_residual = 2g·sin(Δ₋) = 2g at full strength). Closing the
gravity channel **opens** the surface channel. Complete decoupling requires
simultaneously satisfying two conditions — and the second condition (Δ₋ → 0, φ₋
back to vacuum) is impossible as long as any gravitational potential exists.

**T6 and T7 answers:**
- T6 (two-phase noise): In the two-phase system, V″(φ₊) = 2g·sin(D₊). At the
  gravity equilibrium (D₊ = π/2), noise is **FINITE**: S ~ 1/(2g) = minimum. This is
  the opposite of single-phase T6, where noise diverges at D₊ = π/2. The two-phase
  system avoids the T6 noise divergence at the gravity operating point. Noise diverges
  instead when D₊ → 0 (vacuum, no gravitational coupling).
- T7 (Hawking correction): φ₋ does not modify kappa or T_H. At the horizon,
  m²(φ₋) = 2g = ω_gap² — the surface mode mass equals the breathing mode gap exactly.
  A new PDTP Original: the φ₋ mode and the breathing mode are the **same excitation**
  at the event horizon.

## 1. Definitions

**Eq 113.1** [DEFINED]:
```
D+ = Delta_+ = psi - phi_+    (gravity coupling gap)
D- = Delta_- = phi_-          (surface mode phase)
```

where φ₊ = (φ_b + φ_s)/2 and φ₋ = (φ_b − φ_s)/2 (Part 61 change of variables).

Corresponding coupling factors:
```
alpha_+ = cos(D+)   [single-phase alpha; 1 = fully coupled, 0 = Leidenfrost]
alpha_- = cos(D-)   [surface mode coupling; 1 in vacuum, 0 at equilibrium]
```

**Equilibrium values of D− (from Part 62, reversed Higgs):**

| Environment | Φ_grav | D− equilibrium |
|---|---|---|
| Vacuum (Φ = 0) | 0 | 0 (flat Goldstone direction) |
| Near any mass (Φ > 0) | > 0 | π/2 (stable minimum) |

**Physical meaning of D− = π/2 near matter:**
The surface condensate φ₋ is in anti-phase with the gravity condensate φ₊. The
product coupling 2g·sin(D₊)·sin(π/2) = 2g·sin(D₊) reduces to the single-phase
result. The range of φ₋ perturbations around π/2 is:

```
range = c / omega_phi  where  omega_phi = sqrt(m^2(phi_-)) = sqrt(2g*sin(D+))
```

At Earth surface: Φ ≈ 6.96×10⁻¹⁰, sin(D₊) = √(2Φ) ≈ 3.7×10⁻⁵, range ≈ 8 pm.
At solar surface: range ≈ 1 pm.
The φ₋ equilibrium is established within picometres of matter sources — macroscopic
gravity (nanometres to AU) always operates in the D₋ = π/2 regime. The two-phase
system is effectively single-phase at all observationally accessible scales.
(Note: earlier versions quoted 1.9 nm using sin(Φ) ≈ Φ. The correct Schwarzschild
mapping gives sin(D₊) = √(2Φ), which is ~53,600× larger for Earth. Physical
conclusion unchanged — both ranges are sub-atomic.)

## 2. Product Coupling in Tan Language

### Starting point [Part 61, Step 2]

From the trig identity cos(A−B) − cos(A+B) = 2·sin(A)·sin(B):

**Step 1:** Expand the coupling with A = D₊ and B = D₋:
```
L = g*cos(psi - phi_b) - g*cos(psi - phi_s)
  = g*cos(D+ - D-) - g*cos(D+ + D-)
```

**Step 2:** Apply the identity:
```
= 2g * sin(D+) * sin(D-)
```

**Eq 113.2** [DERIVED, SymPy S1, residual = 0]:
```
L_coupling = 2g * sin(D+) * sin(D-)
```

### Tan rewrite

Using sin(x) = cos(x)·tan(x):

**Step 3:**
```
sin(D+) = cos(D+) * tan(D+) = alpha_+ * tan(D+)
sin(D-) = cos(D-) * tan(D-) = alpha_- * tan(D-)
```

**Step 4:**
```
L_coupling = 2g * alpha_+ * alpha_- * tan(D+) * tan(D-)
```

**Eq 113.3** [DERIVED, SymPy S2, residual = 0]:
```
L_coupling = 2g * cos(D+) * cos(D-) * tan(D+) * tan(D-)
           = 2g * alpha_+ * alpha_- * tan(D+) * tan(D-)
```

**Limiting behaviour:**

| Limit | alpha_−·tan(D−) | L_coupling |
|---|---|---|
| Vacuum (D− = 0) | 0 | 0 (no gravity) |
| Equilibrium (D− = π/2) | sin(π/2) = 1 | 2g·sin(D₊) = single-phase |
| Leidenfrost + vacuum (D₊ = π/2, D− = 0) | 0 | 0 (truly decoupled) |
| Leidenfrost + equilibrium (D₊ = π/2, D− = π/2) | 1 | 2g·1·1 = **2g (maximum!)** |

---

## 3. Ratio Diagnostic tan(Δ₋)/tan(Δ₊)

### Derivation

**Eq 113.4** [DERIVED, SymPy S3, residual = 0]:
```
tan(D-)/tan(D+) = [sin(D-)/cos(D-)] / [sin(D+)/cos(D+)]
                = sin(D-) * cos(D+) / (cos(D-) * sin(D+))
                = [alpha_+ / alpha_-] * [sin(D-) / sin(D+)]
```

SymPy S3: expand tan(D₋)/tan(D₊) − sin(D₋)·cos(D₊)/(cos(D₋)·sin(D₊)) = 0. ✓

### Physical interpretation

| Limit | Ratio | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Vacuum (D− = 0) | → 0 | Surface mode off; no gravity |
| Near matter (D− = π/2) | → ∞ | Surface mode maximally engaged |
| D− = D₊ (equal gaps) | = 1 | Balanced modes |
| Leidenfrost only (D₊ = π/2, D− < π/2) | → 0 | Gravity saturated; surface below max |

**Numerical table:**

| Case | tan(D₊) | tan(D₋) | Ratio |
|---|---|---|---|
| Vacuum (D₋ = 0, D₊ = 0.01) | 0.01 | 0 | 0 |
| Earth surface (D₊ ~ Φ, D₋ = π/2) | 3.7×10⁻⁵ | ∞ | ∞ |
| Equal gaps D₊ = D₋ = π/4 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| Leidenfrost (D₊ = π/2, D₋ = π/4) | ∞ | 1 | 0 |

The ratio diverges near matter (surface mode dominates) and goes to zero at
Leidenfrost (gravity saturated, surface below equilibrium).

## 4. Reversed Higgs Mass in Tan Language

### Derivation

From Part 62 (reversed Higgs, corrected equilibrium D− = π/2):

The effective potential for φ₋ at fixed D₊ is:
**Step 1:** From the coupling L = 2g·sin(D₊)·sin(D₋), the potential is
```
V(D-) = -2g * sin(D+) * sin(D-)
```

**Step 2:** First derivative:
```
dV/dD- = -2g * sin(D+) * cos(D-)
```

**Step 3:** Equilibrium at dV/dD− = 0: cos(D₋) = 0 → D− = π/2. ✓

**Step 4:** Second derivative:
```
d2V/dD-^2 = 2g * sin(D+) * sin(D-)
```

**Step 5:** At equilibrium D₋ = π/2:
```
m^2(phi_-) = V''(D- = pi/2) = 2g * sin(D+) * sin(pi/2) = 2g * sin(D+)
```

**Eq 113.5** [DERIVED, SymPy S4, residual = 0]:
```
m^2(phi_-) = 2g * sin(D+)        [exact]
           = 2g * alpha_+ * tan(D+)   [tan language; valid away from horizon]
```

SymPy S4: d²V/dD₋²|_{D₋=π/2} − 2g·sin(D₊) = 0. ✓

### Key limits

| Limit | D₊ | m²(φ₋) | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| Vacuum | 0 | 0 | Goldstone: massless |
| Weak field | D₊ ≪ π/2 | ≈ 2g·D₊ ≈ 2g·Φ | Part 62 result recovered |
| Event horizon | π/2 | 2g = ω_gap² | **Breathing mode gap!** |

### Horizon coincidence [PDTP Original]

At the event horizon (r = r_S), α₊ → 0 so D₊ → π/2. The φ₋ mass becomes:
```
m^2(phi_-)|_{r_S} = 2g * sin(pi/2) = 2g = omega_gap^2
```

The breathing mode gap ω_gap = √(2g) (Part 99, Eq 99.1) **equals** the φ₋ mass
at the horizon. These are the same excitation viewed from two angles:
- φ₋ is the surface condensate mode (bulk − surface half-difference)
- The breathing mode is the radial oscillation of the condensate
- At the horizon, both freeze with the same characteristic frequency √(2g)

**Mass table (g = g_cond = M_P·c²/ħ ≈ 1.86×10⁴³ rad/s):**
Schwarzschild mapping: α₊ = √(1−2Φ), sin(D₊) = √(2Φ) [exact from sin²(D₊) = 1−α₊²]

| Environment | Φ_grav | ω_φ (rad/s) | Range |
|---|---|---|---|
| Vacuum | 0 | 0 | ∞ |
| Lab (100 kg, 0.3 m) | 2.5×10⁻²⁵ | 5.1×10¹⁵ | 58.7 nm |
| Earth surface | 6.96×10⁻¹⁰ | 3.7×10¹⁹ | 8.1 pm |
| Solar surface | 2.1×10⁻⁶ | 2.8×10²⁰ | 1.1 pm |
| NS (r = 3r_S) | 0.167 | 4.6×10²¹ | 0.065 fm |
| Horizon (r = r_S) | 0.5 | **6.09×10²¹** | 0.049 fm |
| ω_gap = √(2g_cond) | — | **6.09×10²¹** | — |

The horizon row and ω_gap are **identical** — the φ₋ mode saturates at exactly the
breathing mode frequency.

## 5. T6: Two-Phase Noise Analysis

**Corrected result:** The two-phase noise is **finite** at the gravity equilibrium.

### Derivation

Single-phase T6 (Part 110) found: V″(φ₊) = g·cos(D₊), so S ~ 1/(g·cos(D₊)) diverges
as D₊ → π/2 (Leidenfrost, α₊ → 0).

**In the two-phase system at D₋ = π/2:**

**Step 1:** L = 2g·sin(D₊)·sin(π/2) = 2g·sin(D₊)

**Step 2:** Effective potential for φ₊ (with ψ fixed):
```
V(phi_+) = -2g * sin(psi - phi_+) = -2g * sin(D+)
```

**Step 3:** Derivatives with respect to φ₊:
```
dV/dphi_+ = 2g * cos(D+)         [force on phi_+]
d^2V/dphi_+^2 = 2g * sin(D+)     [curvature; DIFFERENT from single-phase]
```

Note: d/dφ₊ of −sin(ψ − φ₊) = cos(ψ − φ₊)·(−1)·(−1) = cos(D₊). Then d²/dφ₊² gives 2g·sin(D₊).

**Eq 113.6** [CORRECTED]:
```
Two-phase: V''(phi_+) = 2g * sin(D+)    [sin, NOT cos as in single-phase]
Noise susceptibility: S ~ 1/(2g * sin(D+))
```

### Key contrasts with single-phase T6

| State | D₊ | Single-phase V″ | Two-phase V″ | Two-phase noise |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Gravity equilibrium | π/2 | g·cos(π/2) = 0 (diverges!) | 2g·sin(π/2) = 2g | S = 1/(2g) **MINIMUM** |
| Partial coupling | π/4 | g/√2 | g√2 | moderate |
| Vacuum | 0 | g (stiff) | 0 (flat!) | **diverges** |

The two-phase system inverts the noise profile. D₊ = π/2 (the single-phase "Leidenfrost")
is the **two-phase gravity equilibrium** (from Part 63 chi map: χ = φ₊ + π/2). At this
state, two-phase noise is at its minimum, not its maximum.

**Plain English:** In two-phase, "Leidenfrost" = the normal gravity operating point. The
noise is quietest there, and only diverges if gravity is completely absent (D₊ → 0).
The T6 noise problem is a single-phase artefact; the two-phase system does not suffer it.

## 6. T7: Does φ₋ Modify Hawking Surface Gravity κ?

**Answer: No.** φ₋ at equilibrium does not source φ₊.

**Eq 113.7** [VERIFIED]:
```
kappa = (c^2/2)|d(alpha_+^2)/dr|_{r_S}   [from T7, unchanged]
```

At the horizon: D₊ = π/2, so φ₋ equilibrium has D₋ = π/2. The force on φ₊ from φ₋:
```
dV/d(D+) = -2g*cos(D+)*sin(D-)   =  -2g*cos(D+)   [at D- = pi/2]
```

This is the same gradient structure as single-phase (g → 2g absorbed), so κ is
unchanged. T_H = ħc³/(8πGMk_B) remains exact.

**New PDTP Original — Eq 113.7b:**
```
m^2(phi_-)|_{r_S} = omega_gap^2 = 2g
```
φ₋ and the breathing mode are the **same excitation** at the horizon.

**Emission threshold for φ₋ Hawking quanta:**

| BH | T_H (K) | T_gap = ħω_gap/k_B (K) | Emits φ₋? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Stellar (10 M☉) | 6.2×10⁻⁹ | 4.7×10¹⁰ | No |
| Intermediate (10⁶ M☉) | 6.2×10⁻¹⁴ | 4.7×10¹⁰ | No |
| Sgr A* (4×10⁶ M☉) | 1.5×10⁻¹⁴ | 4.7×10¹⁰ | No |

For all stellar and supermassive black holes, T_H ≪ T_gap. φ₋ Hawking emission
requires a Planck-mass black hole (T_H ~ T_P). Unobservable in practice.

## 7. Full Two-Phase Leidenfrost Condition [PDTP Original]

### The two-switch picture

The two-phase coupling L = 2g·sin(D₊)·sin(D₋) is like two switches in series.
Single-phase "Leidenfrost" (D₊ = π/2) only opens the **first** switch.
The second switch (D₋) is independently controlled by the gravitational potential.

**Eq 113.8** [PDTP Original]:
```
Full decoupling in two-phase requires SIMULTANEOUSLY:
  (A) tan(D+) -> inf   (gravity channel off: D+ = pi/2)
  (B) tan(D-) -> 0     (surface channel off: D- = 0)
```

**Eq 113.9** [PDTP Original]:
```
At D+ = pi/2 (single-phase Leidenfrost) with D- at equilibrium pi/2:
  L_residual = 2g * sin(pi/2) * sin(pi/2) = 2g   (MAXIMUM coupling!)
```

When the gravity channel closes (D₊ = π/2), sin(D₊) = 1, which drives φ₋ to its
**strongest** equilibrium state (D₋ = π/2). The surface channel is maximally
engaged precisely when the gravity channel is "off."

### Coupling vs D₊ (with D₋ at equilibrium)

| D₊ (°) | α₊ | |sin(D₊)| = |L|/2g |
|---|---|---|
| 0° | 1.000 | 0.000 |
| 30° | 0.866 | 0.500 |
| 45° | 0.707 | 0.707 |
| 60° | 0.500 | 0.866 |
| 75° | 0.259 | 0.966 |
| 90° | 0.000 | **1.000** |

The coupling **increases** as Δ₊ increases toward π/2. At the single-phase Leidenfrost
point, the two-phase coupling is at its MAXIMUM.

### Implications for Goal 2 (phase decoupling)

In a gravitational field, condition (B) cannot be satisfied: any gravitational
potential drives φ₋ to π/2 (D₋ = π/2). Complete decoupling would require removing
the gravitational source entirely — which defeats the purpose of an anti-gravity
device. The two-phase structure provides a **protection mechanism**: matter cannot
become gravitationally invisible while inside any gravity field.

---

## 8. Single-Phase Recovery

**Eq 113.10** [VERIFIED, SymPy S5, residual = 0]:
```
At D- = pi/2:  L = 2g * sin(D+)

Define chi = phi_+ + pi/2, so D_chi = psi - chi = D+ - pi/2:
  sin(D+) = sin(D_chi + pi/2) = cos(D_chi)

Therefore: L = 2g * cos(D_chi)   [single-phase, g -> 2g]
```

The factor 2 is the G_eff = 2·G_bare result from Part 61/63, absorbed into the
measured Newton's constant G_N = G_eff.

**Summary of the tan framework in two-phase PDTP:**

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| tan(D₊) | Force/coupling ratio in gravity channel (T1–T8 results unchanged) |
| tan(D₋) | State of φ₋ mode: 0 = vacuum, ∞ = matter equilibrium |
| Product tan(D₊)·tan(D₋) | Total coupling diagnostic |
| Ratio tan(D₋)/tan(D₊) | Surface vs gravity engagement |
| m²(φ₋)/g = 2·sin(D₊) | Reversed Higgs mass in tan language |

## 12. Open Questions

- [ ] Can the two-phase Leidenfrost condition (B) — D₋ → 0 — be
  achieved by **removing the gravitational potential** rather than by
  mechanical decoupling? If a device can screen Φ locally (e.g. a Faraday-
  cage analogue for gravity), then φ₋ would relax to vacuum and condition (B)
  would be satisfied. Relevance: T29 (phase self-locking) and T31 (converging horn).
- [ ] Does the ratio tan(D₋)/tan(D₊) have a measurable signature in
  gravitational wave polarimetry? The ratio encodes the relative engagement
  of the two condensate modes — could this appear as a polarisation asymmetry?
- [ ] Can the horizon coincidence m²(φ₋)|_{r_S} = ω_gap² be derived from
  a symmetry argument rather than algebraic coincidence? It suggests the
  horizon acts as a φ₋ resonator tuned to the breathing mode frequency.
