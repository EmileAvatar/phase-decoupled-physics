# Electricity (Phase-Decoupled Physics Summary)

This document summarizes electricity using the Phase-Decoupled Physics framework
and the renamed functional physics vocabulary used throughout this repository.

Electricity is treated as a **phase-driven interaction**, not a force-based one.

---

## Core Definition

**Electricity** is the controlled redistribution of **charge-phase imbalance**
through mobile **Charge Carriers** within the **Motion Framework**, mediated by
the **Charge Interaction** via **Light Messengers**.

Electric phenomena emerge from **phase gradients**, not particle pushing.

## Fundamental Components

- **Charge Carrier** (formerly Electron)
  - Mobile standing-wave matter unit
  - Weakly bound to composite matter
  - Highly responsive to phase gradients
  - Primary agent of electrical behavior

- **Positive Core Assembly** (formerly Proton)
  - Anchored standing-wave structure
  - Establishes stable charge reference points

- **Light Messenger** (formerly Photon)
  - Phase-change messenger for charge interaction
  - Transmits electromagnetic phase adjustments

---

## Electric Charge (Reframed)

- Charge is a **phase orientation property** of standing-wave matter
- Positive and negative charge represent **opposed phase alignment states**
- Neutral matter contains **balanced phase orientations**

Charge is not a substance — it is a **geometric phase condition**.

---

## Electric Fields

- Electric Fields are **Charge Interaction Phase Gradients**
- They define:
  - Directional phase slopes
  - Preferred alignment paths for Charge Carriers
- Fields are not forces acting at a distance
- Fields are **persistent geometric states** of the Motion Framework

**Why fields feel “real”:**
Objects respond because their internal matter-waves must re-align to the field’s
phase geometry.

## Voltage (Electric Potential)

- Voltage represents **stored phase imbalance** between regions
- High voltage:
  - Large phase mismatch
- Low voltage:
  - Small or neutral phase mismatch

Voltage is the **potential for phase correction**, not stored particles.

---

## Current (Electric Flow)

- Current is the **coordinated drift of Charge Carriers**
- Occurs along a charge phase gradient
- Charge Carriers already move randomly
- Current introduces **directional phase bias**

---

## Conductors and Insulators

- **Conductors**
  - Weak phase binding of Charge Carriers
  - Smooth, continuous phase paths
  - Example: metals

- **Insulators**
  - Strong phase binding
  - Disrupted or blocked phase paths
  - Example: glass, rubber

---

## Resistance and Heat

- Resistance is **phase friction**
  - Between Charge Carriers and the matter lattice
- Heat is produced when:
  - Energy is lost correcting phase mismatches
  - Converted into lattice vibration (thermal motion)

---

## AC and DC Power

- **Direct Current (DC)**
  - Static directional phase gradient
  - Charge Carriers drift consistently
  - Example: batteries

- **Alternating Current (AC)**
  - Oscillating charge phase gradient
  - Charge Carriers oscillate locally
  - Phase information propagates efficiently

---

## Energy Transfer (Non-Local Behavior)

- Energy does **not** primarily move inside wires
- Energy propagates as **field phase reconfiguration**
- Charge Carriers act as:
  - Anchors
  - Boundary conditions
- Power transmission occurs through surrounding fields

**Why energy transfer is non-local:**
The system responds as a coupled whole, with phase alignment changes propagating
near light speed.

---

## Magnetism

- Moving Charge Carriers distort local Motion Framework phase
- This creates **rotational phase gradients**
- Magnetism is a **secondary geometric effect** of charge motion

Electricity and magnetism are unified phase behaviors.

---

## Lightning (Extreme Case)

- Lightning is rapid large-scale **phase equalization**
- Air undergoes phase barrier collapse
- Visible bolt is intense Light Messenger emission
  during rapid correction

---

## Relation to Phase-Decoupled Transport (PDTP)

- Electricity represents **phase manipulation at charge scale**
- Gravity represents **phase locking at mass scale**
- Both rely on:
  - Phase
  - Frequency
  - Coherence
  - Gradient geometry

**Why EM scales into PDTP logic:**
Electromagnetism and gravity share the same phase-control mechanics, differing
only in coupling depth and stiffness.

EM systems act as **engineering precursors** to spacetime phase control.

---

## One-Line Summary

Electricity is the controlled redistribution of charge-phase imbalance through
mobile standing-wave carriers within spacetime, governed by phase gradients
rather than forces.
